1.0 out of 5 starsSo bad, I couldn't finish it.
ByR. A. Staszewskion May 26, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I was looking forward to Paula Hawkins new book. Unfortunately, it was so disappointing that I couldn't finish it. The switching between multiple characters made for a confusing read. Not any of the characters were relatable nor did I care about them at all.
Don't waste your money.

The construction of this story is too heavy to allow flow. The story is told through the visions of so many people that you loose what it is all about. Definitively no comparison to her earlier work.

Sorry, looked forward to this, but quit halfway due to too many characters, no guide to who they are or who they''re talking about (coz they're not engaged in any actions), it's a struggle to follow which timeframe each chapter is in.

ByEmmaon May 25, 2017

I would have returned this book to Amazon but it was preordered and I didn't start reading it on the release date. Needs a rewrite! Too many characters. Confusing plot, running off into Neverland. I stuck it out only because (1) I couldn't return it, and (2) Girl on the Train was such a good read. What a disappointment! :-(

1.0 out of 5 starsThank you for Girl on a Train....
ByLittlebookwormon May 14, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
Unfortunately this book had me rolling my eyes, cringing and laughing out loud in places. I'm surprised it made it to print in this state. Told from ten perspectives, all two dimensional, unlikeable and identical (except for the odd bit of swearing from a couple of characters), countless pages which should have been cut and clunky narrative devices. A huge disappointment.

4.0 out of 5 starsSuspenseful and Great plot, but needed more character development and a better ending
ByJames J. Cudney IV (Jay)on January 8, 2018
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
Into the Water by Paula Hawkins was the book selected by my blog followers as my Book Bucket read for January 2018. Each month, I hold a poll where you can pick from 12 books I want to read, rotating a new one in and out each month. I was excited to read this one, but hadn’t read Girl on the Train before, so Hawkins is a new author for me. I enjoyed the book a great deal, despite a few areas that didn’t quite work for me, but I’d still recommend it to others as a strong thriller and suspense novel.
The novel focuses on a small town in England, following a core set of about 10 characters. Chapters alternate to provide the history and perspective of multiple deaths in by drowning in a local river. It all begins with the death of a suspected witch from several hundred years earlier, culminating with a few deaths in modern times that could be suicide, accidental or murder. As each character shares parts of the story, readers learn what truly happened to each victim.

Ignoring the historical murders, the current day plot is intricate. Several teenagers fight to be popular or earn respect while in high school. Sisters struggle to accept their differences with one another. Parents and children argue about parenting styles. Families are broken by affairs. Police detectives walk a fine line of doing the right versus the wrong thing. Each of the stories are weaved together in a way you can’t help but want to know all the connections. And there is, of course a ‘surprise’ twist in the end… which for many readers, probably won’t be a surprise.
I’m primarily a plot reader, followed closely by character. The plot is definitely strong; however, at least 50% of the characters have some flaws or issues in how they were written. Keeping characters in the grey zone is important within a suspense novel; readers need to know that they might be missing part of the picture, but in the end, it should be clearer than it was in this book. For 3 characters, I felt like the actions didn’t quite match what we’d come to expect from the personalities we’d gotten to know – and it wasn’t due to the grey area. It felt like a totally new character had replaced the ones we’d spent attaching ourselves to. If there are connections we just failed to see because of how good the writing is, then I am OK with it. But if it feels disconnected, then I think the book fails a bit. That’s what I felt happened here… what started out as a 4.5 rating began going south as parts of the plot unraveled. It was clear the entire way that something wasn’t right with a certain character, yet the twist in the end doesn’t do any justice to ‘why’ certain things happened.

All that said… as I kept turning the page, my interest was held and I liked many aspects of the book. I lowered my rating by 1 star because of how it seemed to fall apart in the end… ending somewhere between a 3.5 and a 3.75, rounded up to a 4 in the rating. I’ll keep reading Hawkins’ novels, but if another has a similar downturn, I might not stick with it.

1.0 out of 5 starsDon't buy this book
ByHouston Readeron May 13, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
This book defies all the intuitiveness of a good mystery. The characters and timelines are so confusing that any mounting suspense from a clearer, more linear narrative is lost. I had to constantly re-think who was who and when was when. I am not sure that the lack of clarity was not an attempt to try to make the storyline more interesting. At any rate, I rarely feel moved to write a review but this book was a waste of time and money. I started skimming as best I could in hopes that it would improve but it never got better.

ByKindle Customeron May 15, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I appreciate a good mystery novel and some suspense and yes I read Girl on a Train. There is no comparison of these books. Into the water so so hard to follow I had to restart the book again and then half way I to it I was called to work for 18 hours so I decide to pick the book up and I had to go back a chapter every time to refresh where I was. This book was good but by far the hardest to follow for me. Definitely not a stay up all nighter can't wait to dive in type of story.

5.0 out of 5 starsAbsolutely Fantastic
Byjona ledgerwoodon June 12, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I can't for the life of me understand why there are so many poor reviews! There are multiple characters, yes, but it doesn't take more than a few chapters to get a good grip of who each person is and their role in the story. No more characters than what you would find in your average TV show, and probably a lot more fleshed out, too. The storyline is gripping and there are many memorable quotes throughout the book. Be sure to watch for tiny details, or else you won't see the twist coming! Would definitely recommend this book for anyone who loves stories about troublesome women and their tendencies to go too far in the search for the truth.

2.0 out of 5 starsDisappointing
Byashley son May 15, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I had really high hopes for this book since I've been seeing it raved about all over the internet lately. I did like Girl on the Train, so I decided to give this a try. I'm not sure if my expectations were too high, but I did NOT like this book. I've read a lot of books that are narrated by alternating characters, but this was ridiculous. At least 10 different characters back and forth back and forth, hard to keep up with. The entire book was just all over the place. The big "twist' of the book wasn't very shocking. Just overall disappointing.

4.0 out of 5 starsExcellent but confusing...
ByLori H.on March 19, 2018
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
Let me start by saying, I do like this author a lot. The Girl on The Train was one of my favorite books. Her writing style is so descriptive that it just sucks you right in from page one. The story line made sense however the amount of characters made it confusing. I actually created a cheat sheet with all the names to help me remember who they all were. The story is told through all the different perspectives of all the different people. I think it could have been told using half the amount of pages if there were fewer characters. I confess that it got to the point that I was no longer intrigued or even enjoying it. I skipped from 54% to 86% to cut through a lot of what seamed repetitive to me. I didn't really make a difference, I wasn't at all lost. I didn't see the ending coming so that was good!
Paula, please write more books! I do love your style. This book was just a bit too confusing and difficult to get through. Thank you.

5.0 out of 5 starsinto the water
ByLauren Coodleyon July 18, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
Hmmm...other reviews here were negative.. I found this book fascinating and brilliant. yes I had to go back sometimes and reread stuff, but as a historian I enjoyed the clues--as well as the historical perspective--and the way the characters shifted, like first person impressions are so often wrong. If this were 20 years ago, this would be hailed as a powerful feminist story of what still happens to women.

Having read The Girl on the Train I find it hard to believe that the same person wrote this ! Silly plot that bored me and way too many unnecessary characters that added nothing but confusion to the story. Skimmed the last couple of chapters looking for something that would make me care about why this book was written ? What was the point of it ? Found nothing but irritation that I had wasted my time!

4.0 out of 5 starsThe Drowning Pool
ByPaul Janenschon October 8, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
The body of Nel Abbott, a local writer, is found in the river that meanders through the town of Beckford in northern England. Appropriately enough, this part of the river is called the Drowning Pool.

A few weeks earlier, the body of teenager Katie Whittaker was found in the Drowning Pool. Some years before that, the body of Lauren Slater Townsend, wife of a respected police official, was found in the Drowning Pool. The rumor is that her son Sean, then a young boy, saw his mother plummet from the top of the cliff.

Women have been found dead in the Drowning Pool since 1679. Usually it was unclear whether the victim fell, jumped or was pushed. In her unfinished history of the Drowning Pool, Nel wrote: “Beckford is not a suicide spot. Beckford is a place to get rid of troublesome women.” How did Nel, Katie and Lauren end up lifeless in the Drowning Pool? Were they “troublesome?”

Like the river, the story meanders, told through 11 characters, all of whom were connected with at least two of the three Drowning Pool victims. Warning: It is hard to keep track of who’s who. Take notes.

We spend the most time with Jules (or Julia) Abbott, sister of Nel. The 10 others who push the narrative include Lena, Nel’s difficult teenage daughter; Mark, a teacher who was a mentor to Katie; Erin, a police officer; Patrick, widower of Lauren and father of Sean, who is now a police official, himself, and Helen, Sean’s wife. All 11 hide secrets. The most surprising is revealed to us at the very end.

Paula Hawkins’ first thriller was “The Girl on the Train,” a No. 1 bestseller around the world and made into a movie. “Into the Water,” her second thriller, is almost as good. An intriguing locale. Lots of twists and turns. But too complicated. Unless you like to take notes.

3.0 out of 5 starsBe prepared!
BySue Appletonon September 28, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
If, like me, you had to concentrate hard to keep all the characters and time-shifts in The Girl on the Train clear in your mind, be prepared. I had even more trouble with this one. In fact I had to draw up a chart/family tree to remember who all the characters were and who they were related to. This was at least in part because the story was not as compelling. Also the characters were not as well drawn. It would have been easier if I had had time to read it quickly but I did not, making it more likely that I would lose track.

ByKathy L.on April 8, 2018
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
I was concerned with all of the negative reviews about this book, but I jumped right into it, and found it fascinatingly original and difficult to put down. Yes, there are many different characters that are involved in this mystery, but all add to atmosphere and storyline, some in the past. The best thing to do Is to read the book when you have time to finish it quickly before the threads are forgotten. It’s worth it !! A great story with unforgettable and very flawed characters. Great character development as each character speaks their own truth. Don’t miss this one!! Loved it!!

2.0 out of 5 starsNot The Girl on the Train -- this book missed a few stations
BySonpoppieon October 27, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
While this starts off well and grips the reader, it is difficult to sustain interest to the end. Perhaps there is too much jumping from character to character, too many characters, too much dialogue. I lost interest, skimmed along. By the end I didn't care about the story or who had done it. It failed to deliver. Not The Girl on the Train -- this book missed a few stations and was derailed before the halfway mark.

I loved this book! I gasped at the end. It is sometimes hard to follow. I found myself making a character chart so I could remember who was who and what they did. I felt like I was Jules, trying to solve the puzzle. It is one of those books that, if you enjoyed it, you would want to go back and reread so you can see the hidden meanings and understand what the real truth and motive different characters had. It could've been a little less confusing but I couldn't keep my eyes off the book so I recommend to anyone who likes a mystery thriller.

5.0 out of 5 starsAnother Winner From a Masterful Plotter
ByWillam Mi!es Dowdon July 3, 2018
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
Paula Hawkins has a clever, devious, ironic way of looking at things. Things like people, no matter their ages or circumstances; like communities, no matter whether city, country, or something in between.

Just as she did in "The Girl In the Train," Hawkins utilizes what filmmakers call " jump cuts" to ricochet from one first-person narrative to another as her characters reveal themselves a layer at a time, and those layers themselves construct the mystery and the many possibilities it leads to.

A small town overshadowed by suicides -- or are they? A rebellious teenaged girl. A demanding family patriarch. An odd and elderly con artist crone. Two tortured sisters unable to overcome a dark secret from their childhoods. A reserved police detective and his disgraced subordinate. The cast goes on and on, as do the twists and turns that may or may not link up at some point.

Paula Hawkins has earned a place on my personal list of deeply gifted portrayers of time, place, and people such as the illustrious likes of James Lee Burke, Nelson DeMille, and David Baldacci.

3.0 out of 5 starsThis is brilliant or a mess
ByS. Stagemanon July 26, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
I was looking to sink my teeth into this book since I loved Girl On The Train, which I read twice because it was such a great read. But this book.... I agree with many of the other reviewers - too many characters, too much jumping around. about 2/3rds into the book I went back and read some of the beginning which helped me tie some of the threads together. All along the author is giving us clues. She is weaving a very complex narrative with lots of players. And then in the last sentence, the zinger! I cannot image that this was an easy book to write. I have to admire the mind of the author and her ability to produce a book like this. I happen to like books that are in sequence. It is how my mind works and understands things so I cannot blame the author totally for me being confused. The book is actually brilliant in its conception. I think it is problematic to have a first book be so great! The pressure to write subsequent books of its equal is probably intimidating. ( I think the same thing happened to Deborah Harkness of Discovery of Witches. Ms. Harkness started out with an amazing book. Managed to carry off with a sequel but by the time the third book came around she struggled with the organization and it was unorganized and confusing.) I'm only giving Into the Water 3 stars because Ms. Hawkins's book was so confusing. I will say this though...Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down.

3.0 out of 5 starsNot a great follow up to "Girl on a Train"
ByG. Bankson July 13, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
I was a huge fan of Paula Hawkins first book "Girl on a Train". This one wasn't horrible but also wasn't the best. It seemed like she rushed to finish it. Like she was given a advance for her next book and only given so much time to write it and she threw this together.
She wrote it very similar to how "Girl on a Train" is written. Multiple characters perspectives. This book was a little harder to follow because there were too may characters to keep track of. I found myself needing to go back to previous chapters to review characters.
There were a couple story lines that she started and they felt undone. Not fully developed. The big reveal at the end was a little anti-climatic. This book will not deter me from reading any more of her books, however this was not a very good follow up to "Girl on a Train." Paula can do better. And hopefully her next book is.

2.0 out of 5 starsA book with lots of characters and little action
ByTeacher Nannaon September 28, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
First of all, let me say that I was a huge fan of GIRL ON THE TRAIN, so I pre-ordered this book expecting to be absolutely enthralled by it.  Wrong!  It took me almost three months to read it (and I am a very fast reader when I want to be) because it was so boring!  There were at least ten characters; each chapter started with the name of a character and the action was just not there for me.  I could barely keep up with who was who among all of the characters:  the detectives Sean and Erin, Sean's father Patrick, Sean's dead mother, Sean's wife Helen, Nel Abbott and her sister Jules and Nel's daughter Lena, the teacher Mark Henderson, Katie and her family.  I had to almost keep a list until I found one online and kept it handy.  Then, there was the water...seemingly a place so cold and deep that it had beckoned to many over the years to commit suicide there.  The basic theme of the story is why these people committed suicide (if they did) and the effects of their deaths on those left behind.  Ho-hum!  This would have made a good short story, but as a novel, it was lacking in the mystery and action that would have encouraged me to read more of it daily.  This is one of those books that I am glad I finished it because I paid for it, but next time the author has a new book, I will wait for the library edition.  I give it a solid 1.5 stars, and that is only because it does have an ending.

2.0 out of 5 starsDidn't meet my expectations
Bycarolee maldonadoon October 13, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
This review is really hard to write, I had very high expectations and unfortunately they were not met. I think like most people that read Girl on the Train (and I was not one of those people that read it after hearing the hype, I am an avid reader and pretty much anytime a new psychological thriller drops I'm all over it) I was anxiously awaiting Into the Water.

I am not going to delve into the book details except to note that there were so many characters that it became hard to keep track of them and for the author to properly develop the characters. She skipped around a lot and it lacked the intensity of her debut book.

Generally when I read books by the same author (which I tend to do when I find that I enjoy an authors writing style) I find that they have a similar undertone, you can feel the author through the words and the way they are expressed. This book DID NOT have the same feel or style as her first book. If I had picked up both books blindly without knowing the author of either I would never know they were written by the same person. This may not be a negative to some, but for me it was.

I am not saying it was the worst book I've read, far from it, but it was a disappointment. With all that being said I would still pick up the next book Paula Hawkins puts out to see if she just missed the mark on this one.

4.0 out of 5 starsTreading Water
ByCarol Milleron June 22, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
"The Girl on the Train" is so fantastic I immediately ordered "Into the Water". Essentially a good yarn, I was bewitched by its intricacy, until I found it repetitious and excessively laborious. One wants to shout, "Get on with it!" And since each chapter is a character in the novel, who makes himself felt and describes the incident at hand, the continuity is complicated by its inconsistency. The blur of names doesn't help. The reader has to sort them out as he or she goes along. These "blips" or fragments are conspicuously third or first person, with no apparent rules.Yet the book is riveting enough to hold one's attention, you will make it to the end.

I read Girl on the Train early before it became cool. Not saying that for any reason other than my like for the book was unassisted. I really found it to be a page turner. I had a different experience with Into The Water .... I found it very difficult to settle into .... too confusing .... a lot of names to remember and where they belonged on the timeline. However, once I got the rhythm, I found it quite enjoyable and nicely paced. If you have trouble getting into it, give it just a bit more time .... Good rewards.

This was a good solid read and I definitely enjoyed it. It kept me turning pages and especially towards the end kept me riveted. I had some issues with the many characters and had a hard time keeping them straight and trying to figure out why they didn’t like Nel and what their relationship to her was. But once I got it all straight I was off and didn’t put the book down till it’s satisfying conclusion.

I recommend this one to lovers of psychological suspense, family drama and great mysteries. This was a good read.

4.0 out of 5 starsNot as good as Girl on the Train, but still a decent read!
ByCBon August 1, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I decided to read Into the Water because I absolutely devoured and loved Girl on the Train. I didn't really "devour" Into the Water the same way, though. I mostly used the audiobook, and it took me a little while to get into the actual story, and it seemed a little slow to me. I felt like there were a lot of characters (almost too many), and it took me some time to figure out who everyone was and how they related to what was going on. I felt like I should have taken notes!

Don't get me wrong--I did enjoy reading and listening to this book, and it is similar to Girl on the Train in that there are so many possibilities until the very end, which I liked. If you enjoy reading thrillers and mysteries, then this is definitely worth a read! I enjoyed the audiobook, too--each character has a different actor reading the part, which helps because (like I said) there are so many characters.

3.0 out of 5 starsReally?
ByInkedBookDragon on January 30, 2018

Have you ever longed for a book to come out that you were counting the days until it was released? You had enjoyed the previous work by the author so much that the prospect of another book filled you with joy? I wanted this book to be good. I longed for it to be good. It had to be good after the author's debut novel, The Girl on The Train took the world over. I read that book at once. I needed for this book to be good. Life is full of disappointments. It is a real shame that this was one.

You know what they say about setting stuff up to fail? I fear that this may have been the case for a lot of people in regards to this book. I wish that I could praise it from the rooftops but I cannot. There were too many points where my mind completely glazed over because the POV kept jumping back and forth. The plot was predictable. Some of the characters were strong while some of them were just lacking. I found myself frustrated at times because of the flow.

I am rating this book Three Stars because I did not hate it but it left me disappointed. What good is a mystery when you can figure it out almost immediately? I am not rating it lower because the author does a decent job on the backgrounds and locations. You do feel like you are there. She is a promosing author but she is better than this book. I will be waiting to see what she does in her next offering. My recommendation is wavy on this one.

3.0 out of 5 starsGood second novel
ByClassySassyShopperon June 26, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
Three and a half stars. Please amazon let us use half stars! Oh boy. Twists and turns galore. Wonderful story. This is somewhat clunkier than Gone Girl in its execution. There are MANY character points of view to follow initially. (The different chapter voices that have become the writing style du jour kind of get bogged down when the author goes past three characters IMY). But once I established who was who I enjoyed this A LOT! I won't get into plot so as not to spoil anything but PH writes her characters with a believability and authenticity -- I really feel as though I'm there. Bring on the next novel!!

3.0 out of 5 starsToo many characters almost spoil this decent thriller
ByRoberta L Kowaldon June 6, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
Overall a fun read - but with so many characters telling their own narratives it can be hard to follow ("Wait - who is this again?"). While we get a LOT of red herrings along the way - by the time we get to the end and the " big reveal" there are SO many things to reveal it felt rushed -and some of the "relationships" and connections between various characters felt forced. Some of them have no earthly connection to the plot - a long-dead sister who was a police officer- a sleazy ex-boyfriend... and the story would have been fine without them.

2.0 out of 5 starsSophomore slump
ByAmyon May 23, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
If you are hoping for another The Girl On the Train, you'll be very disappointed. The so-called suspense was often confusing or dull. I really didn't care about the characters and was very glad when I finally finished it. This was a good effort by Paula Hawkins, but it felt more like a first draft that needed a few rewrites before it could become interesting.

4.0 out of 5 starsI really enjoyed this book
ByAmazon Customeron June 25, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
When Nell Abbott turns up dead at the bottom of a local river, questions are raised. She is the second one in a matter of months. These women are just the latest in a string of women throughout the centuries who ended their lives in this water, the "drowning pool". An investigation is launched to determine if it was suicide, and if so determine why. But the investigation delves deep into the towns history and pulls details from the murky water and secretive town that speak to three deaths, not just one.

I really enjoyed this book. I felt the writing was on par with The Girl on the Train. The story was interesting and immersive, I found myself staying up late to read this book. The characters were relatable and understandable, and I like how Hawkins make each of her characters human. Not one is too good or too evil, they are all just human and you can understand how they became the way they are through her narrative. The turns of this book pulled me in.

The one negative part that kept this from being a five stars for me was the number of narrators. Holy narrators. I'm not even sure now, after finishing the book, that I know how many there were. I'm going to put it at eight, with sprinklings of the long dead women's views. Nine! That was really hard to keep track of and remember who was who as I w as reading. I understand why she chose to give these nine voices life, but I think some of their stories could have been told from the main characters and it would not have detracted from the book. I would have preferred that to the ever changing narrator.

3.0 out of 5 starsI WISH I COULD SAY I ENJOYED THIS MORE
ByBEACHLOVEon June 25, 2018
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
I wanted to love this. It started out as an intriguing read filled with history and atmosphere. I was interested to see how the present tied to the past history of "The Drowning Pool" (where witches were tested in the middle ages), and to discover how all the pieces fit together. For the first third of the book I was really engaged but then as the myriad of characters and POV's became overwhelming, and didn't move the story arc forward, I began to lose interest. Yet, I still hung in for what would be the major plot twist I couldn't see coming. Except there wasn't one. A very unsatisfying conclusion with several loose ends I still can't resolve. I didn't love "The Girl On the Train" because I found the characters very unlikeable. However, the plot was first-rate. In this book, I didn't like the characters much either. But I liked the plot even less. Ms. Hawkins is such an excellent writer that I wish I could say I enjoyed this more. If there's a third book, I will probably still give it a chance.

2.0 out of 5 starsWitchunt
ByMsvineson September 8, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I was not fond of this book. Part of the problem may have been that I was reading it on my tablet, so could not leaf back and forth to keep track of the multiple characters and the timeline. Honestly, I did not feel as if any of the myriad characters were fleshed out, none were particularly likeable or sympathetic. The women all seemed to be defined by how they had been victimized by men and the men were all surly. The title was what originally attracted me (that, plus the Amazon recommendation), but by the end of the book, I was so tired of the path between the village and the drowning pool that I was ready to drop the book into the water. The author has poetry in her, but this book just didn't work for me.

Too many characters, too many story lines. I feel a bit duped given Hawkin's prior novel (which was terrific READ). I lost track and gave up reading it. There were so many opportunities to grab me . .. alas, the effort to track who was who doing what to whom was so absurdly challenging that I lost the central story being told and the joy of a good book.

2.0 out of 5 starsI Really Tried
ByPeacephyllon June 28, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I gave this clunker until chapter 8 before bailing on it. The overuse of adjectives and the hackneyed character descriptions made what could have been an engaging plot basically not worth the effort for me. Call me a literary snob but I choose,in the finite time allotted to me in life, to read well-written books. My advice to the author: Next time just tell the story! Don't muck it up with annoying and irrelevant adjectives and metaphors. The 2 stars are for the plot which, to paraphrase Brando in "On The Waterfront, coulda' been a contender.

2.0 out of 5 starsDear Paula Hawkins, my expectation from you was way more tgan this
ByAnamikaon July 26, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
This book was so complex that you loose track of all the characters. To make the matter worst - the language . Author had actually used such a difficult style of writing here compare to her last book (language was so simple and clear) that sometimes I didn't even understand what was she trying to say. This book had such a high price on kindle that I was hesitant to buy it first but consideing the fact that this was coming from Paula Hawking I anyway bought it. Now I am simply regretting it. Further I felt the book kept screaming that there was some connection between all the women who died but what I understood from reading this crap that the only connection they had was dying in the same river- what a nonsense . I had never expected such a boring ending. Revealing a suspense in a last one line after reading it for more than 10 hours was a huge disappointment. So many loopholes- what was the reason of adding that diet pills mystry, patrick killing the cat just because she was pregnant , Julia being so miffed with her sister just because she called her fatso, no idea what sean told Jeannie and what Jeannie told Nickie about Lauren, was she actually cheating on her husband or herf husband itself was some psycho maniac. The girl on the train was so clear about all its revelation but here I guess author wanted us to use our own imagination and come to a conclution. Well I won't tell others not to buy it but don't say later that you were not warned about.

2.0 out of 5 starsSomewhat boring
ByKindle Customeron July 7, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
Not even close to her previous novel, Girl on a train. The author, even in the previous novel, has difficulty engaging the reader early in the book. This novel really drags until about three quarters into the book and, then, only for a brief time. One gets very tired of hearing about the river, particularly when the river truly has so little to do with the plot.

Hawkins' follow up to The Girl on the Train pales in comparison. The perspective shifts often in this new narrative, and even though each chapter is labeled, it is often difficult to tell who's doing the talking. Plus...I figured this one out ahead of the finish. I am terrible at solving fictitious crimes, and I do not fully trust any mystery that I can solve. Maybe I'm being too harsh, because The Girl on the Train was so good. Into the Water isn't bad, but it's not a strong follow up.

This store was very very predictable and while you are waiting for there to be some hidden twist at the end you are left asking yourself, "is that it?!?!".

3.0 out of 5 starsNot as good as The Girl on the Train
ByMelon December 10, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
This novel has some intriguing sections, but is not as compulsively readable as The Girl on theTrain. The story structure alternates between the different points of view of at least 4 characters, which is interesting at times, but also a bit confusing. The mystery of the rivers history involving suicides and witch-drownings was intriguing, and hinted at a possible supernatural element, that I enjoyed. But I felt dissapointed but the ending. Also, I didn't really feel fondness for any of the characters. Overall, I feel this novel is overrated. (And I loved The Girl on the Train.)

4.0 out of 5 starsNot nearly as complicated as others have said..
ByDanion December 26, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
I was incredibly hesitant to buy this book due to all the poor reviews, BUT I am glad I did. Yes, the story is told through the perspective of a plethora of characters, but I really didn't find it difficult to keep up with, and for the most part, actually enjoyed the different perspectives. I did buy the audiobook version, because I listen to books while at work, so maybe having different narrators helped. But I was able to stop, and restart a few days apart and pick right back up with no issues. I think Girl on the Train was definitely better, and this doesn't t quite make my "favorites" list, but it did have a good story and I enjoyed it, and I really don't think it's as hard to keep up with as some people have made it sound. Looking forward to her next book!

4.0 out of 5 starsDammit Paula
ByAshleigh Evanson June 1, 2018
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I knew the author was leading me in one direction but I still did not see where she was really going. I knew I was being deceived but let it happen. As with Girl on the Train the characters in this book were so complex and broken and utterly human. It was hard not to care for them, including the crazy ones. Paula knows how to write pain and trauma. There were so many different issues raised in this novel as well; suicide, rape, child abuse, etc but the main one was the varying degree of wrong relationships we all have in our lives. Each character had a wrong relationship, something off, creepy or even illegal about it, and I loved that.

This book is a must read.

I don't know what it was about this book that just didn't grab me, I loved girl on the Train..but then this is an earlier work, I think?..I put it down about 25 pages from the end. For some reason, I had trouble keeping track of all the characters, kept mixing up names.. and since the story is told from several points of view and jumps back and forth in time..a device that is often annoying unless done skillfully, often found myself having to back track when I'd resume reading after a break. There are good elements..dialogue, certain characters, but overall I found the water muddy.

2.0 out of 5 starsI enjoyed Girl on The Train
ByCourtneyon October 21, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
I enjoyed Girl on The Train, so I was enthused to buy this 2nd book by Paula Hawkins. It didn't live up to the hype at all. This book seemed like it was written far too quickly. A mishmash of several different characters that was very difficult to follow. I kept flipping back to previous chapters to recall who was who. The characters weren't properly fleshed out or developed, so I never felt like I got to know them, unlike Rachel on Girl on The Train.
The tale centered around a small English town where women were drowning mysteriously periodically through the years. The story leads you to believe that this had sort of a supernatural twist to it, but it does not.
I read this quickly and was glad when it was over.
Not a good 2nd effort from Paula Hawkins at all.

I find it difficult to understand how anyone could describe this book as the Number One Bestseller. What was the editor thinking about and who reviewed this book?Why do writers have to plan out such tragic story lines, and why are books so long nowadays? I had difficulty following the story line, mainly because of all the characters in the book, and because of all the twists and turns along the way. I just couldn't keep track of them all Second books are very difficult to write, especially after the success of the first one, and this book did not live up to my expectations.

4.0 out of 5 starsI enjoyed this book
ByThe Pages In-Between- Tracy Thomason May 11, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
Paula Hawkins had a genius idea, throw multiple narrators into one book, give them a few pages per chapter, leave you hanging at each one. It makes you want to race through the pages, to get to the end, to see how they all tie together. Did she succeeded? For the most part, yes.

This was a cast of despicable characters, not one of them had any redeeming qualities. I still however really enjoyed this book, and I found it hard to put down. I was waking up at odd hours just so I could read. Last night I finished the book, and I found myself angry at how it ended. While it was a great ending, I just found that I wanted more. I do wonder, if this is going to be turned into a movie as well. This is one of Springs most hyped book release, and I do feel like it lived up to that hype. It was a very creative, edge of your seat thriller. Can't go wrong there!

ByShirley A Benedicton September 24, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I liked this book, I know the jumping around of character narratives may seem hard to follow, so I decided to just read each chapter as a part of the mystery and not worry about the character and was able to follow the pieces of the story and so far into the story no longer had any confusion as to who was who as far as the charscters. So I would advise that aoproach instead of trying to keep the characters straight. I teally found it interesting and like the mystery upon mystery. Definitely worth the read.

ByKindle Customeron January 22, 2018
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I found this book to be very intriguing . I liked the pace at which it moved. There were several interesting mysteries all unraveling at the same time. I could only give this book four stars even though I really enjoyed it, found it to be quite a page turner, and finished it in one day. It had too many characters, which made it very confusing at first. I often found myself going back to remember who people were for the first part of the book. Most of the answers to the mysteries were pretty obvious. It left one loose end that I guess doesn't matter, but bothers me. The book came to a satisfying conclusion.

Weak plot. Characters were one-dimensional, uninteresting, poorly developed and as a reader, I did not care much about any of the characters. I did not like the ending either. I read "Girl on the Train" by this author and loved it, but this was a huge disappointment. The only reason I even finished this book was that I was reading it for a book club. Otherwise, I probably would have stopped reading after the first couple of chapters. Sorry to give such a negative review but it just fell so far short of her other book.

Unfortunately the author went took a perfectly engaging and imaginative story into the water and drowned it with a chapter by chapter disjointed narrative. Each character focused and narrated chapter disrupted the flow and continuity of the story and frequently required back-paging to determine who was speaking about what and at what stage of the story line.

1.0 out of 5 starsThis sinks to the bottom...
ByLucyfanon June 20, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
This truly has to be THE MOST confusing, uninteresting, mind-numbing, train wreck of a book that I have read to date-- I had to FORCE myself to finish it!

The story (if it can even be called that?!) is told in short, choppy chapters, alternating between way TOO MANY characters, and is all over the place in timeframe. I was constantly flipping BACKWARD to try to make sense of what I had just read!

No suspense is ever built, the characters are one-dimensional and unappealing, and the ending is so dull, lackluster, and subtle, that you find yourself asking, "That's it?", rather than feeling any satisfaction, after devoting hours to the reading of this literary mess.

I didn't care for "The Girl On The Train", so I thought that perhaps this author's style might have improved with "Into The Water"; but, unfortunately, this story is even MORE disappointing.

In my opinion, it's definitely NOT worth spending the money and time on a book that should also be thrown into a "Drowning Pool"!!!

I loved Paul Hawkins' first book, so I figured this one would be a slam dunk no brainer! Not so much. I had a hard time following along and trying to figure out where she was going with the characters, etc. I had a difficult time with the back and forth, each chapter with a different first person speaking. Finally I made myself a cheat sheet of all of the characters so I could refer to it. This helped. I do appreciate how it ended and really stuck with it for respect for Paula, but I do not recommend this book. Hopefully if she writes a third book it will be better. I am still a fan of hers!

2.0 out of 5 starsNot a page turner
ByJAYNE C. RICHARDSon July 27, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I loved Paula Hawkins' debut novel "The Girl on the Train." I read it over the course of a single day.

This was much less compelling. There were a lot of voices, and not being a page turning narrative, coming back to it was confusing. I had to flip back to remember who was talking and their place in the story. If there had been some delicious plot twist at the end (for which I held out hope until I read the final word), all the voice change may have been worthwhile. But, the ending was predictable and unsatisfactory.

I'll pick up her next one and hope she returns to form.

It did get a little confusing between all the different narrators, at first, but once you got a hold of them, it was a very interesting story filled with many twists, lies, betrayals, etc. that left me unable to put the book down until the last sentence. I found myself suspicious and doubtful of every character at some point, and I found the book entertaining. Without any spoilers, the ending had a topical and poignant overall message for the story at whole.

4.0 out of 5 starsNot The Girl on the Train... what secrets would you keep to protect those you love?
ByVikkion June 4, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
This is not like The Girl on the Train so if you start reading this book thinking that it will be, you will really be disappointed. That being said, I really enjoyed reading this book. I love historical fiction and this had the fake history of a town that had 17th century witch trials in its past and it seemed to curse the women in the town every generation since. There is a river that runs through the town of Beckford and forms a swimming hole next to a cliff that the locals have started calling "The Drowning Pool." Generations of "troublesome woman" have died here-- drowning in it or falling or jumping to their death from the cliff above into the pool. The chapters are short and jump from different characters perspectives and from past to present. A local woman, Del Abbott, who has caused controversy in the town by asking questions and researching the Drowning Pool's history for a book, is the latest body pulled from its waters. Jules Abbott, Del's sister, comes back to town on word of her sister's death and to care for her niece, Lena. Lena's best friend also recently died in the pool and is reacting poorly to both deaths but seems unsurprised by her mother's death. It quickly becomes apparent that many people in the town are keeping many secrets. The first quarter of the book I was having trouble keeping the characters straight (most of whom I disliked) with the changing perspectives every chapter but the intrigue of all the secrets every character seems to be keeping kept me reading. The themes of damaging secrets that are pulling families and friendships apart while being kept to protect the people they love flows throughout the book and makes you question if you would do the same for love. I had a pretty good idea what happened about half way through the book but the plot twists to get the truth kept the book from becoming boring. That and Nicki, the psychic (or fraud depending on who you ask), wandering around, talking to her dead sister and dropping hints made this an enjoyable read for me. The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is there were too many different characters/ perspectives at the beginning that made it a bit confusing and I felt the last chapter wasn't needed/ the book would have been better without, in my opinion.

I gave this book a 4 out of 5 stars on Goodreads.

ByKelly O.on June 14, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
I LOVED Girl on a Train and maybe because of that I just expected more, but I wasn't in love with this book. It was somewhat hard to follow with so many characters, so many story lines, alternating points of view and transitioning from past to present. It was all just a bit too much. It was okay, but if I had to do it again, I'd pass.

4.0 out of 5 starsTwists and turns make this a must finish read
Byamazonaholicon June 20, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
Just when you think this book is over, it is not. There are parts that are clearly unbelievable and other parts not finished. The characters are well developed but not always well described and they have inconsistent behaviors that frustrated me. All in all a decent beach read. It could make a good movie if the screen play takes some liberties.

5.0 out of 5 starsGood book - highly recommend
ByJamieon September 5, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I initially read the book because it was written by the same author as "The girl on the train", but I personally liked this book better. I was surprised at the ending. It took a bit of getting used to reading the story from all the different characters perspectives, but I think that made the book more interesting. I would highly recommend this book - it is a different read than "The girl on the train".

The early part was difficult to keep straight but eventually I learned the characters and their relatedness (mostly). Perhaps I might have created my own scorecard--or the author might have provided one. I think that would not have taken away the mystery. All in all I loved the book and didn't want to put it down.

3.0 out of 5 starsthis was nowhere near as good as her first novel
ByJudy Rushon July 1, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
this was nowhere near as good as her first novel, The Girl on the Train, there were so many characters in the beginning I had to go back and forth
trying to figure out if they were new or someone I had already read about. It dragged in places and it was a relief when I finally finished it. I had very much looked forward to reading it when first I heard about it, but sorry, not as good as it could have been.

4.0 out of 5 starsMany twists....
ByStephanie B. Leeon October 18, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I really enjoyed this book. Right when I thought it would go one way it went the other and back. I still have some questions that weren't answered, but that isn't always bad. Sometimes annoying. I did like the breathing room she gives each character. Not for them but for my interpretation of them. Which changed and grew throughout the book. I am being evasive as not to give anything away. I really enjoyed all the big and little revelations. It's not that one can't maybe figure out the big mystery in most books of this nature. But right when I was certain I knew the answer, she threw me off with yet another layer of the personal dysfunction of a character and that then took me back to "oh....wait a minute......maybe...". And that, I love.

1.0 out of 5 starsDisappointed with this Book

I loved Paula Hawkins first book, " The Girl on the Train". I couldn't put the book down. When her second book came out I couldn't wait to read it. It was the biggest disappointed. I couldn't even get past chapter 6. It is so unlike me, not to read the entire book, but "Into the Water" put me to sleep. I cannot recommend this book and I gave it one star for my being a fool for buying it after so many bad customer reviews.

4.0 out of 5 starsAudio version highly recommended!
ByAlicia G. Moreeon June 6, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
In case you’ve been living in a cave with no access to electricity or social media, you have probably seen all the promotions about Paula Hawkins newest release, Into the Water. But does it live up to the hype? After listening to her first novel The Girl on the Train (read by Clare Corbett, Louise Brealey, and India Fisher), which I really liked, I was very excited to read her second novel.

Into the Water is read by Laura Aikman, Rachel Bavidge, Sophie Aldred, Daniel Weyman, and Imogen Church, a rather lengthy cast, as there are quite a few characters who make this book twist and turn and throw you for loop after loop. While it started a bit slowly, it did pick up the pace and there were a couple of turns I truly did not see coming. And then I listened to the ending three times because I just absolutely could not believe what I was hearing!

For over 300 years the Drowning Pool has claimed many lives of Beckford women, whether they were accused a witchcraft and sorcery, adultery or to leave the world of their own accord, and Nel Abott has researched them all for the book she plans to publish.

When Nel dies falling into the “Drowning Pool” that has fascinated her all of her life, her sister must return to the town she ran from so many years before and swore she would never again set foot. This suicide, only months after a teen girl’s suicide at the same place leaves many in the town worried and many quite satisfied. Nel’s daughter knows it was suicide, but her long-lost sister stands at odds against the 16-year-old niece she has never met and swears that Nel had to have been pushed.

This book has quite a few negative feedbacks online. However, the audio version of this book has more positive responses than negative. I find this very interesting because I also listened to The Girl on the Train and loved it, but the people I knew who read the book didn’t like it. I actually have 2 friends who didn’t like The Girl on the Train book but listened to the audio and really liked it. So my suggestion here would be to start reading them and if you don’t like them, then listen to both of them. I really think it makes all the difference!

I highly recommend this book in audio form.

I enjoyed this book although I probably liked The Girl on the Train a bit better. The characters were well-formed and, as usual, not all the characters appear as real suspects. One is surprised at the end or at least is surprised when all the loose pieces of the story are put together. Recommended!

2.0 out of 5 starsDisappointing
ByKristen M Sullivanon June 23, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
After reading The Girl on the Train, I had high hopes for this book. The story dragged on and on and while it felt like the whole book was building up to something dramatic and exciting, it ended with disappointment. The ending was extremely predictable and I felt like the buildup ended with a less than exciting conclusion. There were SO many characters in this book and it went back and forth so often that it was hard to keep up. Many of the characters and story lines seemed like they were not even entirely necessary and were meant to (unsuccessfully) throw suspicion onto different characters. In the end, all they did was create a lot of confusion. Definitely not my favorite read.

Given the author’s high acclaim with The Girl on the Train, I expected a thriller that robbed me of sleep. Written in several peoples’ perspectives, it was challenging to keep up with at times. However, from a writing standpoint, this was a cleaver way of telling the story. I felt the ending was rushed and a bit sloppy. It was an enjoyable read, but not what I was hoping for.

3.0 out of 5 starsShould be a movie instead of a book.
ByAshleyon May 20, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
If you make yourself a flowchart of all the characters and how they relate, then you will enjoy this book, a lot more than trying to recall the background of a character who means nothing to you yet, because their significance isn't revealed until later. I didn't find myself emotionally attached to any of the characters as they weren't given much depth or even many characteristics. My attention went to remembering who was who rather than having the characters established. It took away meaning from each encounter or the various plot lines. I loved the premise of the book and thought it was very original. I wish the author had given more descriptions of the town and the river for my imagination to run with. It seems as though the scenery would be beautiful. I think this would make a great movie because 1) the scenery, 2) it would be easy to remember the characters on screen and 3) the characters could actually display emotion and have more attributes than just their dialog, and 4) there hopefully wouldn't be mistakes such as letting a person who attempted suicide by drowning return home immediately... to take a bath! ...rather than being admitted for psychiatric observation, or using the uncommon phrase "hide nor hair" in two consecutive chapters, among others. Where are you, editors?! If you make it through Parts 1 & 2, you will be rewarded with the more entertaining Parts 3 & 4. Every character and detail ended up having significance (except maybe Jeannie); you just have to claw your way to the end to figure out what that is. Great storyline, just not written the best.

ByRachelon August 14, 2017

I recently read this book for my book club and really enjoyed it. It's not a page turner like Girl on the Train. The writing style is the same and the flipping back in forth between character point of views each chapter is the same though but there are WAY more characters in this book. That was the most challenging part of the book was keeping all the characters straight. A lot of the characters in the book were unnecessary to the plot. The book kept me on my toes with all the twists and turns and I could not have predicted the ending at all! I tried through out the book and couldn't figure it out.

3.0 out of 5 starsPlodding and poorly written
ByStacy A. Haineson June 7, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
It appears that Paula Hawkins has found a formula and is apparently going to inflict it on us again and again. It barely worked in The Girl on the Train, but this time we are buried by so many characters (many of them unnecessary as it turns out) that her trademark red herrings and big surprise twist don't fool us at all (I figured out who dunnit as soon as the character appeared). Too bad, because a pared-down version of the story could be compelling if it wasn't for one other caveat I have: her painfully pedestrian writing. All of the characters have the same voice, whether it's in first or third person. I suspect this is a rush job, whipped up for Hollywood.

I loved Girl on the Train, so looked forward to another book by this author. The writing style made it very difficult to follow the story line as it tries to tell the story through MANY different characters' perspective. Each chapter is a different character. It jumps around so much that I lost track of who the characters were, therefore the story was lost as well. I forced myself to finish, but what a waste of time and money. By the end I was ready to jump into the drowning pool.

This follow up book is somewhat confusing- there are sides of several stories from several people. There are police officers, former police officers, sisters, daughters, wives all telling different sides to how several troublesome women drowned. Confusing to keep track of who is telling the story and which death is being discussed. Good story but still some missing pieces as to how some of the deaths occurred - all were ruled suicide but these people tell a different story.....

I gave it five stars because after 3 chapters I was hooked. Sometimes I had to remind myself who was speaking as there are quite a few characters using the first person. It was an engrossing tale based on the underlying emotional trauma that occurs when people die in a conspiracy of deceit. Deceit woven with jealousy and heartbroken stories, past and present.

Unfortunately Hawkins' follow up to Girl on a Train was not nearly as good. There were so many characters it was difficult to keep them straight, and probably because there were so many, most of them were under developed. The entire first section of the book was very confusing, and left me with no interest to continue reading other than hoping that it got better. This may be a situation where the author was pushed to produce a new book too quickly in order to capitalize on the strength of Girl on a Train. Hopefully her next novel will be more like her first.

This story started a little slow but caught up with itself about 2/3 of the way through. Fortunately the storyline itself was interesting enough to keep me trudging through the more confusing bits until things finally started to fall in place. The characters are gritty, ragged around the edges and often unlikeable, but they all fit together nicely regardless. Not the frantic page burner of The Girl On The Train, but a pretty solid followup. Looking forward to what's next.

2.0 out of 5 starsToo many characters to keep track of
ByThe Blonde Likes Bookson November 4, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I absolutely loved The Girl on the Train, so when I heard Paula Hawkins had a new book coming out, I couldn't wait to pick it up. Unfortunately, I was not a fan of her sophomore novel, Into the Water.

My biggest problem with it was that it was really hard to follow. There were more than POVs throughout the book, and on top of trying to remember who was who and how they were all connected, there were chapters told in the past, and chapters told in the present, and it was just a mess. It was way too hard to follow, especially given that many of the chapters were very short. I really think I would have enjoyed the book more had she stuck with only two or three point of views. I felt that the additional ones didn't add anything to the story.

The other problem I had with the book was that I felt like there were a few unanswered questions. I won't spoil anything, but the last sentence of the book didn't work for me. Other books have done the same thing and left me with an "omg!" reaction, but this didn't have the same reaction. I wanted to know more about the random psychic character - why bother creating a character that's "psychic" if you aren't going to do anything with them? What was the point of showing the chapters from Nel's book?

Overall, it felt like Hawkins tried to throw too many ideas into one book. I can imagine that after the success of The Girl on the Train that there was likely a lot of pressure for her to come out with a second amazing book, but this one wasn't it for me. I rated it 2 stars, and that was only because there were 100 or so pages in the middle that actually held my attention. The other 300 pages in the book I had to push myself to get through. All in all, for a book marketed as a thriller, it wasn't very thrilling. Confusing, convoluted, and predictable, yes. Thrilling, no. I can't say I'd recommend this one.

3.0 out of 5 starsA Good Try
ByBethon May 15, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
INTO THE WATER is complex the way the best thrillers are. Various mysteries are going on, all interrelated, resulting in a smooth storyline.

* Why does Jules hate her sister Nel?
* Did Nel commit suicide or was she murdered?
* Are Nickie’s accounts of murder reliable or is she just a nut?
* Why did Katie, a 15-year-old girl who seemed to have everything going for her, commit a most unlikely suicide?
* Are Nel’s stories of all the women throughout history who have jumped or been thrown into the river fact or fiction?
* Why does Patrick maintain the cottage by the river? What went on at this site?
* What is Lena hiding that might give more insight to the reason Katie would commit suicide?
* Why does Helen have Nel’s bracelet? Does this mean she murdered Nel?
* And why has the river that runs through Beckford been the scene of the suicides or murders of so many women there? Why is it alluring?

These are only some of the mysteries going on in this book.

This complexity is good. But don’t expect INTO THE WATER to be like Paula Hawkins’ other novel, THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN. They’re not alike at all. That is not only in storyline. While I criticized THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN, I also admitted that it is unputdownable at times. INTO THE WATER isn’t, ever.

Partly that is because most chapters of INTO THE WATER are first-person, some third-person, accounts, each by one of the characters in the story. While the book thus moves along, you may find, as I did, that this becomes an exercise in memorization. There are so many characters, each with his or her own viewpoint and mysteries, that I spent most of the book trying to keep them all straight and remember who did and said what. Many times I had to page back to previous chapters to remind myself.

INTO THE WATER is a good try. But, probably, readers who liked THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN will be disappointed in INTO THE WATER

Good books hold my attention. Great books are devoured by me. This book was neither. Sean and Patrick Townsend could have been attention getters. I'll try Paula Hawkins one more time....looking for a better effort.

ByJacqJackon October 12, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
I really looked forward to this book because I loved “The Girl On The Train”. This book is a jumbled mess. The characters are all over the place and I never cared about or connected with any of them. I started reading it mid-summer and just finished; read 4 other books after starting (and before finishing) this one. I just disliked it; tremendously.

This book is compelling, but, alas, not as good a read as "The Girl on the Train." What was most frustrating was the number of characters written in the first person. It took me 1/2 the book to remember them all.

4.0 out of 5 starsGood but long and confusing
ByVictoria J. Connellon July 4, 2018
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
This book is told from like 8 points of view and it gets to be a bit much... it took me forever to get into it, the story didn’t really hold my interest until 60% through. Of course lots of plot twists in the end but would have enjoyed a few of them earlier on instead of all the good stuff happening in the last 20% of the book with the first half being super boring.

4.0 out of 5 starsSECRETS, CRIMES, & PUNISHMENTS
ByLaurel-Rain SnowTOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICEon May 23, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
A single mother turns up dead at the bottom of the river that runs through town. Earlier in the summer, a vulnerable teenage girl met the same fate. They are not the first women lost to these dark waters, but their deaths disturb the river and its history, dredging up secrets long submerged.

Left behind is a lonely fifteen-year-old girl. Parentless and friendless, she now finds herself in the care of her mother’s sister, a fearful stranger who has been dragged back to the place she deliberately ran from—a place to which she vowed she’d never return.

With the same propulsive writing and acute understanding of human instincts that captivated millions of readers around the world in her explosive debut thriller, The Girl on the Train, Paula Hawkins delivers an urgent, twisting, deeply satisfying read that hinges on the deceptiveness of emotion and memory, as well as the devastating ways that the past can reach a long arm into the present.

Beware a calm surface—you never know what lies beneath.

My Thoughts: After the body of Nel Abbott is found in the water, the police conclude that she jumped. But her sister Jules and her daughter Lena, a troubled teen, are not convinced.A short time before her mother’s death, Lena’s best friend Katie had died, also in the river, and Lena is keeping a big secret about the events leading up to Katie’s death. Lena and Katie’s brother Josh are holding what they know close, pretending ignorance.

Because of the history of the Drowning Pool, with suicides ending up there, and then, as Patrick Townsend had been known to say, the river took care of “troublesome women,” some of the women in the English village of Beckford are starting to speculate. Like Jules. And like the psychic Nicki. What stories are the women telling Nel, who is writing a book about the history of the river? Her focus is on how the women are punished, even though the men were also behaving badly.

Years before, Patrick Townsend’s wife Lauren, the mother of Sean, a police officer, died in that river. What had happened? Had she been troublesome? Why does Sean blank out suddenly, and why does he tug at his arm, where someone cut him at some point? What memories are he suppressing?

What really happened between the teacher, Mark Henderson, and Katie? What does Lena know?

Into the Water: A Novel was a convoluted tale with many red herrings, too many characters, and a lot of confusing elements. At the very end, in the last lines, we finally realize what must have happened to at least one of the dead women. But was there more to the story? I could have enjoyed the story more if it had fewer narrators, but the themes of crime and punishment did keep me intrigued. 4 stars.

4.0 out of 5 starsDisappointing
ByRichard P. Santeusanioon September 7, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
Hawkins last book was filled with unlikable characters. She continues the practice in this book. I was initially engaged in the book, but after awhile I started losing interest in who was pushed, shoved, or jumped into the water. It was one theory after another; so much so I just didn't care any more. A disappointing follow-up that, despite my take on it, is selling well.

Do not be tempted to read the last page first, or there's no point in reading this. I wasn't too keen on it in the beginning, but stay with it...it's worth it! Had I quit halfway through, I probably would have given it a 2-star rating, but it redeemed itself, and ended up 4-star. I'm really glad I finished it, otherwise it would just have been a waste of time. The answer is in the last sentence...no peeking!!!

4.0 out of 5 starsA good story
ByKevin D. Gerharton April 14, 2018
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I read this book because of "Girl On The Train". Because of the style in which it is written, told through the eyes of multiple people and jumping to different periods of time, it is difficult to follow for the first half of the book. However, it then becomes a fast-moving and exciting story of murder, revenge, and misled but well-meaning cover-ups. There are a couple of loose ends that are implied but not answered, like the fate of the schoolteacher, but all-in-all, this was a good story, told in a unique manner. I will probably read it again sometime.

The Girl on the Train was wonderful. This one follows the same multi-view, time jumping format. I got lost too often with who was who. The water-suicide-murder theme was more depressing than Train. In the end, it wasn't a satisfying enjoyable read for me. Well written as before.

It is scattered, plodding, and often unpalatable... I question if it is a mystery more because of the disjointed story telling style of too many vantage points than the actual story itself. If you laud "Bestseller" lists more than readable literature then this novel is for you. Finally, the so called "sobering end" isn't.

1.0 out of 5 starsUgh!
ByDominique Wagneron July 13, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
Not quite unlike Girl On The Train, Into The Water falls short on so many literary levels. The suspense is mundane, the characters are stereotypical, there is no real substantial uniqueness to the plot, the language, the reasoning behind the purpose of this tale. Character named Nicki Sage as the story's medium & token "town wacko?" Obviously. Mouthy, teenaged Lena? Of course. Each character is predictable in their own way, leaving Into The Water a mundane, "obligated to finish because I started" page turner that helped me fall asleep on the beach & get a tan. I suppose I can't complain about that! Hawkins seriously needs to step it up.

5.0 out of 5 starsWell Worth the Work
ByMichael Milhaudon July 2, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
A river flows through a small English town. Where the river meanders and slows and eddys is a pool where many in the town swim. Bounded by a cliff on one side, this is the Drowning Pool that was used many years ago to test if women were witches. The problem? Some women are drowning again. Were these drownings suicides or murders?

Into the Water by Paula Hawkins is not a book for passive readers. The overlapping story is told by multiple narrators sharing several points of view. These are damaged people--people who have all dealt with the Drowning Pool in one way or another. Which ones are telling the truth? Which ones are fooling themselves? Which ones are just trying to carry on as best they can?

Each character is fleshed out by the author. No cardboard characters here. The art of Paula Hawkins writing is let the reader know only what reader needs to go. Like all who-dun-its the author keeps you guessing all the way. I had it figured out several times. Ha!

The multiple POVs made me work. But oh what a satisfying read.

This story is full of reader manipulation that only serves to impede the plot. There is a lot of misdirection here, similar to the pedestrian crime dramas on TV that point toward several suspects only to have a totally different person be the bad guy. This is a book with at lot of characters, none of which are likable. I do not recommend this book.

I finished the book because I simply wanted to know what happened next / how everything ended. Girl On the Train was amazing... this book - too many unnecessary and divergent storylines that wanted SO BADLY to be interconnected, but the connectivity was very forced. Also - zero good feelings at the wrap up of the book. Going to binge watch Disney movies to recover. The 2 stars are because I wanted to know what happened next and the story had potential, but the story itself needed refinement.

It takes a bit to get into the story at the beginning, especially since you're reading things from the point of view of many different characters. However, once you get into it the story is great. Little clues are given throughout so that the reader is not in the dark all the way through the book, but slowly putting together the pieces of the puzzle.

ByLisa A.on May 29, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
If you still choose to purchase this book after reading all the one-star reviews, let me take you through how it will go: 1) about 90 pages in, you will get the 300 or so narrators straight. 2) at which point, you will realize you don't care because not a single, solitary one of them is likable. Including the dead characters. 3) if you're still reading, you'll be valiantly searching for the point. 4) if you're ridiculous like me and must read to the end of every book, no matter how bad, you'll be rewarded with an amazing twist and satisfying ending. Kidding. There's no reward. Just a, "this is a joke, right? That can't be what I read nearly 400 pages for."

Honestly, this book is super slow, super boring. Don't waste your precious time. I would have read super market flyers over this and been happier.

This is a stunning book. As soon as I was finished, I began to reread it the same day. I disagree with the reviews that label the book as confusing. You just need to pay close attention when you read it and understand that throughout the story, there are simply things the author is not wanting you to know just yet. Go with it. It all comes together in the most lovely, chilling way. The characters are so vivid and compelling. I never review books even when I love them. I just really felt some of the reviews here were unfair and off base. It is a much richer, more interesting read than The Girl on the Train (which I also loved).

ByJulie Pon September 22, 2017

I was disappointed with this novel, having previously read and loved 'The Girl on the Train'. Into the Water was neither suspenseful, nor 'enthralling'.
I didn't empathise with any of the characters and found it disturbing that I now (a few days after completing the read), have no recollection as to the appearance of any of those characters nor the 'plot'. I will most probably, however, give Paula Hawkins another chance, and read another of her works. Maybe.

Found myself looking back to remember who was the narrator in the chapter and what he/ she had to do with the story.

But, the ending was good.

5.0 out of 5 starsand I loved the way all the narratives fused together
ByDylan D.on June 3, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
This book truly blew me away. I found it to be very complex, and the characters were very intricate. There were many layers to this story, and I found myself unable to stop thinking about it until I finished reading. It's extremely different than The Girl On The Train (which I also loved), and I loved the way all the narratives fused together. Definitely lived up to my expectations!!

2.0 out of 5 starsNot as good as her first in my opinion
Bypickleon February 25, 2018
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
Not as good as her first in my opinion. Same format with each chapter assuming the voice of a different character in the novel, but I couldn't make heads or tails out of their relationships to each other without taking notes on the side. Maybe that's the point, but it makes it confusing when, like me, you read at the end of a busy day.

I read as a book club selection and we had good discussion questions, not sure where they came from, but I did relate to one of the books characters and there is a twist or two along the way.

I love this writer. Girl on the Train was good, and this one is at least equally as good. Hawkins' character and plot development are outstanding and quite unique. I love the way she twists and turns and surprises the reader in the end. Superb writing, in my opinion, and I am anxious to read her next book.

I enjoyed this book, but I did find it depressing. Something about suicide is just so hopeless, its really hard to grapple with those feelings and still enjoy the reading experience. There were times when the book was downright upsetting. But I did enjoy the twists and turns, and I thought the book was interesting. I think her first book was better, just because its not about suuuuch a sad subject.

ByAvidreaderon February 20, 2018
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I was intrigued by the plot and I read the book in one sitting. However, I found myself constantly turning back to the beginning of chapters to determine which character was then assuming the role of narrator. The complexity of the narration interfered with the suspense level, in my opinion. I enjoyed The Girl on the Train much more.

Even though this book felt much more contrived than Girl On The Train, and was also confusing with the many narrators, I still had a hard time putting it down. But I was skimming just to see what happened--not really enjoying the ride. Here's hoping her third book will be more like her first.

ByKathyon July 27, 2017

Undeveloped back stories could have been omitted. The cast of characters was introduced in "rapid-fire" succession without explanation as to who they were or how they related to the other characters. Confusion ensued. Finally had to look up who the characters were and about 3/4 of the way through the book figured out who was who. After all that, discovered the plot to be flat and without suspense.

This book really is a summer read, not much of a plot, shallow character development, and a predicated story line.
I read 70% of the book and when I started to skip pages and still stay up with the plot line, I knew it was time to stop.
Again, if you want a summer read, some thing that you skip pages and most miss the story, and read with a buzz on, this is your book.

Stereotypical small town where everyone has secrets and everyone is the murder suspect. To make it more confusing, some tell the story in first person and others in third person. Be prepared to read or listen to everything twice and use X-ray to just to try to remember who everyone is. No action until about 2/3 of the way through.

Not sure why this has such low rated reviews. I truly found this to be a page turner- slow to start but once it got going I enjoyed the abundance of POVs & how each person’s thoughts & story flowed into another’s. Going from past- to present- to other times in space flowed with an ease that provided foreshadowing which later on connected all the pieces. Really loved this book! Worth the read

Too many characters with connections that were outlined far too late in the narrative - a timeline and character list at the beginning of the book would have made it much easier to follow. Spent too much time figuring out who was on for what vs. enjoying the story and the writing. Had high expectations as the Girl on a Train was exceptional. Into the Water is on the annoying side of dull.

ByJCamposon October 31, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
After reading The Girl on the Train, I was looking forward to reading Paula Hawkins' next book. I must say I am a bit disappointed with this book. The premise sounded exciting and full of potential, but the story simply did not deliver. The beginning was draggy with the introduction of all the characters (way too many), all of whom narrated from their own points of view. What I did like, is the depth of the characters, and how the author managed to make them all come to life. The sense of the place was strong. I loved the cover and the title of the book.

I think my high expectations of this book might have hindered my likability of it. The story, told from every character's viewpoint was an interesting idea, but incredibly hard to follow until about halfway through. Like Girl on a Train, many of the characters are listless and apathetic about life or too warped by their own reality which I guess is human after all but makes it difficult to love the book. Even with several twists and turns I was just left unimpressed.

This started as a real page turner, a psychological thriller. However, it quickly spins out of control, there are so many characters, the reader needs a whiteboard to keep track of who is connected to whom, how and eventually it just becomes too much work to bother. The plot was all over the place as well. It did not feel authentic and became something to get through. Probably best to read in one sitting... easier to follow. Seriously, do take notes.

This is a great book similar to the first by Hawkins. I love the character switches; you get inside each of them. There are not too many characters to follow at all, but yes, there are more than 4 characters, thank God. I almost didn't buy it due to some bad reviews, but I'm glad I did purchase this novel. It had lots of twists and turns to keep my mind busy. This is not a book to read 3 pages and put it down for 3 days, but I don't know how anyone can put it down in the first place! If you like the elementary writing style of some popular authors, then this book may be a bit too much for you; however, if you prefer a more complex writing style that keeps you on the edge of your seat, then you will love this book.

While I absolutely loved The Girl On The Train, I was let down by this book. There were entirely too many characters, too much to follow. It was a good read overall, but still so dissapointed after her first book. It took quite a long time for the buildup, maybe the last 60 pages or so. The rest of the time I was trying to keep the characters organized. Very sad, The girl On The Train was my very favorite book ever.

3.0 out of 5 starsInteresting read
ByTereseon October 20, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
It was a little predictable, but it was an interesting story line. Some bits of it were not really relevant to how things turned out in the end. However, it was still a good read. I only read it because of The Girl on the Train. Not my favorite of all, but not the worst.

3.0 out of 5 starsDisappointed
ByRainier Womanon July 19, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I loved The Girl on the Train and was so awaiting this new book by Paula Hawkins but alas, I was disappointed. It has been quite awhile since I read it and nothing stands out as memorable. Too many characters and I couldn't really care about any of them. Book was not a page turner for me. I'm sorry because I had such high expectations. Hopefully, her next book will be back to "The Girl on the Train" quality. I will definitely not give up on her and will give it another go!

This book was all over the place. None of the characters were likeable, interesting or more than 2 dimentional. I kept waiting for the story to get to the point but it never really did.

I read this in a couple days which is a good book by my standards. However, the beginning of the book was tough. I honor the author’s style but for me it was confusing. The way the characters were introduced and the way that the mystery was unraveled kept making me think I had missed something? It made the first 20% not as enjoyable. The last 10% also kind of dragged on. The best part is the middle. It’s good, but not one of my favorites.

I was fleshed by her first novel The girl from the train. But this was not as good. I found this time the number of plots, persons to high, to confusing. It was hard to understand who is who and what is going on. But all in all it was a pretty interesting book. But I did not understand everything despite having read it twice. I do not think it is my English it is rather the way the book was written.

4.0 out of 5 starsA convoluted tale of a cursed river where several women died.
ByC. F. Croweon May 25, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
The reader could use the aid of some crib notes during the early chapters. Each section begins with the musings and actions of a single character. You can be easily confused as to which character is related to the story or each other.

The dead women pile up during the tale until the history of this ill fated river becomes clear. This is an enticing tale, but the reader has to struggle in the early chapters to follow the thread. A lot of characters are involved here, but not all are essential to the story..

It isn't something that you can speed read, and like The Girl on the Train, you will have to invest yourself into the plot. Once you do, the book is well worth the price of admission.

5.0 out of 5 starsMuch better than "Girl on a Train"
ByCool Parroton June 9, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
Loved this book more than "Girl on a Train". I do like how each chapter is from the viewpoint of a particular character in the book. Sets up the story nicely. The characters had depth, personality and intelligence that was missing (for me) in the previous book. I liked the numerous characters and how they entertained with each other and made the story. The thread of the river, pool and the women who died there was interesting and added to the mystery. However, I have fun trying to guess the outcome and who did what since the author tends to lead the reader down a different path to a surprise ending. Yes, the first part of the book goes slowly, but only to set up the characters and tone of the story. The last 100 pages then go quickly as answers are provided to the reader and a nice tidying up personal stories at the end. It is a quick read and is a fun read over vacation.

The book just wasn't what I enjoy, but I'm sure there are readers who would. It was too depressing for me and I couldn't feel empathy for any of the characters.

2.0 out of 5 stars... looking forward to getting wrapped up in this book like I did The Girl On The Train

I was so looking forward to getting wrapped up in this book like I did The Girl On The Train. However, this one is slow, never really drew me in, and some of the events and characters were unnecessary and anticlimactic which is probably why it seemed so boring.

3.0 out of 5 starsGood but confusing
BySVon June 20, 2017

I liked the suspense and the overall storyline. However, the frequent changes in the points of view was confusing, and I had to read the ending twice to try to comprehend its meaning.

3.0 out of 5 starsdisappointing

A disappointing second novel. There were too many characters all telling their own story. It became irritating and confusing. I found the plot to be very ho-hum.

This book kept me interested and I enjoyed it. That being said, I found parts of the story to be unbelievable and a bit ridiculous.

4.0 out of 5 starsLoved this book!
ByWendimbon May 19, 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
It definitely was not The Girl on the Train and I think that's what I liked about it. Paula Hawkins is a talented writer; her books are different from one another yet I couldn't put either down. The reason for four stars instead of five is this book left me with unanswered questions, such as What happened to Mark Henderson? And what was purpose of the noise that sounded like a dog? That might seem like a strange question but it was mentioned more than once with no explanation. Regardless, I am excited for her next one, though, if there is one.

5.0 out of 5 starsDifferent route but rapid read for second novel
ByAmazon Customeron July 31, 2017
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
Took off like a bullet. Was a bit(small bit) confusing but that's what kept me reading. Had a very intentional give away but guess what? Read & find out. You get to meet a whole new group of wonderfully disfunctional women least of which is a downtrodden psycic. Actresses of a certain wonderful mature age will be ready to kill for that roll. All in all a great summer read. Maybe in her next tome, we'll meet a likable male character!
