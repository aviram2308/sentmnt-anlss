4.0 out of 5 starsMUST READ ! (especially for fall : ) )
ByAmazon Customeron 9 October 2017
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
Must read for October !
honest review : first half of the book is a little boring but its wise to read them with attention , might i suggest. as the story moves to the second half , there are many intense portions. A VERY TALENTED AUTHOR , i must mention. Whatever the author wants you to feel , you feel it for the character. Very good thriller.

5.0 out of 5 starsMust read - one of the best psychological thrillers of the past decade!
ByAparnaon 25 December 2017
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
Really loved the book. Had already read the other two books written by Flynn, which in my personal opinion were better stories. However, really enjoyed the premise and the underlying psyche of this book. The narrative is exactly what I have come to expect of Flynn. The movie clearly doesn't do justice to the book.

4.0 out of 5 starsA must read book.
ByAbhishekon 4 June 2018
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
I finished the book in less than 3 days, compulsively turning page after page, needing to know what would happen next, who to trust, how it would all end. And, at the end, I can add one more thing to the list of things I know about this book:D. A brilliantly written and plotted mystery, a miasma of wretchedness and hate; a book that I devoured but deeply, utterly abhorred.

5.0 out of 5 starsPowerful narrative
ByUrbashi Rahaon 18 July 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I saw the film first, the movie made me read the novel. Truly the.novel is quite powerful. The narrative is written brilliantly. The writing style demands to get in the character's skin. Flynn has successfully created realistic characters showing deep understanding of human nature which is essentially flawed. The writing style keeps you hooked till the end.

5.0 out of 5 starsGone Girl - A holy matrimony?
ByKahlua-TheBookWormon 23 October 2016
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
A marriage is a game that two people play. It smells like strawberry when fresh and like cheese when stale!

Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn will go on to confirm the nasty feeling you have always had in your tummy, dreamt about but never believed it could happen to you in your marriage!A dark, powerful, twisted and Nasty piece of fiction will keep you guessing till the very end. You will end up hating the feminists for corrupting your mind! or may be not, it was just me.

Flynn validates that God is in the Details. Every sentence in this work of fiction reveals a part of the mystery. You begin by feeling, oh I know lady, you married the wrong Guy. You should not have been so open, so sweet! By the time you finish the book, which trust me, should not take more than 24 hours for the lazy, old ones like me, you'd feel like something just ran over you. And you'd be slowly re tracing the puzzle in your head to make more sense of this mystery novel.

Awesome book! I don't want to say anything about the story and spoil it. The quality of the book is good as you can see from the picture.
The suspense in the story will keep you guessing, and there will be a twist to the story, which will knock you out and you'll have to start guessing from the start again

4.0 out of 5 starsGood thriller but feels a bit stretched at times.
ByPulkit C.on 23 December 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
1. Good thriller novel. Has many more levels than the movie.
2. Feels a bit stretched at times and it is easy to skip a few paragraphs over the course of the book.
3. Does a pretty good job of keeping you engrossed in the second half of the book when things pick up pace.

However, I would suggest the book to a person who has patience as far as reading is concerned as the story gets interesting after some time and then the twist makes u realise it was interesting throughout!!

ByYash Advanion 18 May 2015
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
This is excellent. Gripping, Interesting and very well written. The story turned around and that was it, I was restless till I finished it. Even when I would be caught up with work, I would be thinking about the story and wondering what would happen next.

5.0 out of 5 starsThis is Brutally entertaining!
ByAshishon 13 October 2015
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
There are few Novels written such cleverly -they almost haunt you, leave you with a lump. This is an unnerving story of Nick Dunne whose wife, Amy, goes missing on their 5th Anniversary, amidst signs of struggle and both of them telling you their version. Gillian Flynn has a wonderful and different writing style- direct and contemporary. The pace is rapid and the main characters are developed supremely. There is not much description of surrounding but about thoughts and mindsets- I don’t think there are many who understands psychology of characters and present in a better fashion. I shudder to even think to be in situation like this. This is a heady cocktail of difficult love and absolute hatred. It’s not much to say on the suspense (except climax is different from what you would expect)- but just the way things unfold is bone chilling. It is surprising to see how rotten and vengeful a person can become and to use the phrase from the book how in the ugliest ways, lead characters compliment and complete each other.

This one is brutally entertaining and I would definitely read other works by the author.

4.0 out of 5 starsIt does a 180 on you then minute you are not looking
ByAVIDReader wormon 20 April 2014
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
What happens when an over enthusiastic friend of yours sit down to narrate a story and that is what you get with Gone Girl and Gillian Flynn writing style. I have come across this for the first time and frankly it was one of those things that are weirdly good. The whole book is first person narration and trailing back to memories and just like i said before it is like hearing to a hyperactive friend narrating story with sound effects and facial expressions to amuse you and keep your attention straight. Seriously i never knew you could actually write sound effects but Gillian definitely managed to do so.

The book starts kind of on a midway tone wherein you know something is happening but have no clue what is it. Somehow the first half of the book is a bit drag or monotonous which picks up in the second half with a twist and then things turn at every point from there.

To me the book was a tale of two twisted brains caught up in something that made the read an intriguing at the same time a weird one. When you least expect there are twists that leave you spell bound and appreciate the intricacies of the whole plot. No doubt it is a thriller worth buying and shelving in your house. What I liked about the book is the fact that a whole bunch of ugly truth about we as humans and relationships have been vividly painted by the author that finally makes you wake up and look at yourself and that is what a book is supposed to do, to leave an impact. This one surely did it for me. The narration style of the book was somewhat a little different and weird to me

There is a section where there is a very good insight into how women have their husbands wrapped around their fingers in the name of love and the character do come up with a name for it as well "dancing monkeys" which was actually hilarious and that particular chapter was one of the best and sweetest in the book

Just as the case with some of the books i have read, here too the author keeps diverting too much from the main scenario and point and wandering faraway islands with her personal thoughts and character backgrounds. There are certain things in the story that the author points out that is painfully true and stabs at the right pressure points like the instance where through the character how she says that women has painfully gone down to change her character as per the man she meets to make him like her
There are so many things that the author says in the book that makes me want to give her a standing ovation, applaud while saying Bellissimo...Bravo for bringing up the ugly truth.

I would say that more than the plot of the book, it is certain things that was discussed and brought up in the book, that made me love it more.

Grab with this book if you love a good thriller with weird twisted characters and a plot that tightens with progress.

5.0 out of 5 starsCatastrophical Thriller !!
ByRahul Rai Khatrion 29 July 2015
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
Gone Girl , pen down by Gillian Flynn is a terrific read which walk the reader with some awful , bitter truths about marriage life . Writing is so gripping that the reader just ensconced him/herself in his/her chair , with eyes glued to the plot and fingers turning the pages in reflex mode . Every Flip of page , ballooned the grip and makes the reader go through the book as its the last book to read of his/her life . Whole plot is briefed by both the Protagonist .
Plot danced around two writers Nicholas Dunne and Amy Elliot Dunne who lived in in New york but the recession sweep their jobs , leaving 'em unemployed . Nicholas Dunne is portrayed as a writer who wrote about Tv & Books & Movies in magazine and with Internet rolling out steadily crushes the career of Magazine Writers , Nick one of them .He's shown fibbing like a little boy who's desperate to have everyone think he's perfect and so is a glib liar. Amy Elliot , met Nick in a party where they fell for each other , is written as a girl with an explanation for everything . She sever nick to play a happy hubby role & loved to play old testament god when she's not happy .
Everything goes well in initial as a happy-romantic story but turned into a stromy thriller as on the morning of their 5th wedding anniversary , Amy ( As name suggest Gone Girl) got missing and as Police investigation rolled out , Nick flagged up as the main suspect .Blood Mopped out from the Kitchen floor , a half burned Amy's Diary , Nick's Computer examination by police and many other leads staged Nick as the Prime suspect of the crime . Not just with passing chapter , Plot takes a complete U-Turn with Andie's entry who could possibly act as an antidote turned just opposite of it. Every Passing chapter left a chill and addiction to read next and so on .I think the End part makes the reader realise how much worth & fun-reading this fiction is .
Author embedded the inspiring relation between Nick and his twin sister Margo who stays with him in his very thick and thin . Margo is portrayed as the sister who love her brother unconditionally and supports him . Beside , Author has explained how some constituents like Patience , Planning and ingenuity can easily make any mission accomplished . As a critic , author has flagged the amateurish Electronic media shows which labelled any suspect as a criminal , used words as just to elevate their TRPs . And most importantly how much threatful as psychopath is .
The flawless and gripping plot of Gone Girl whaled on me with a hammer until I finished the book . And I think every guy after wrapping up with this book wishes his gf/wife had or will never read this .

5.0 out of 5 starsSmartly written plot ... a page turner
Byakarsh anandon 14 October 2013
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
The story is engaging, the narrative fresh and the characters believable. The narration by both protagonists and twists in the story line make the plot difficult to second guess.

There is so much to like about the book... the witty remarks, the psychological games couples engage in and the sub plots which add layers to the original story line. The mysterious Amy and her disappearance will draw you in and make you think where the book is heading ... only your guess will be wrong in a big twist. The characters are likeable and most readers will enjoy their struggles.

There are a few things which the reader should be forewarned... the book is not for kids, the story takes time to draw you in (so be patient)and the ending could have been more dramatic (in my opinion).

However, if you are looking for a fresh read, make no mistake you will enjoy the book !!!

5.0 out of 5 starsDark and Scary!
ByTushar Gon 24 November 2015
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
Such a scare!

This book is the simplest darkest book I've read. There are books which you have to try hard to understand to feel the darkness. But this is an in-your-face dark. I can't believe how twisted the story is!

First of all, this is a spoiler free review. The book is so amazing, that to speak about it hints at the storyline. So, I'll just praise it and you nod along.

The writer is a lady, and she knows how to capture love. You will feel it washing over you, taking control of your thoughts and making you judge the characters of the book without thinking for a second. But your judgements will keep on changing, and that is the point of this book.

There are many rights and wrongs that happen and you will find yourself trying to rationalize them, after all the author has said about love. There are many twists that will take your breath away and make you happy in a moment, until later when you'll realize that this was the worst piece of news to be delivered by the author yet.

Anyway, this book is not what you think it is. I can vouch for that. You will end it with a numb brain but a hint of a smile. Please, read this at any cost.

3.0 out of 5 starsPsychology of Marriage.
Bykirtida gautamon 11 November 2015
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
Gone Girl is a good psychological thriller around one of the most overlooked subject in the field of psychology- the marriage! Marriage is a very important part of a person's life history and yet many a times it's potential psychological impact in the life of a person is not looked at closely.
Great work by Gillian Flynn to bring this discord of society to the surface.

3.0 out of 5 starsDecent, racy read!
BySrawan Kumar Kamatalaon 18 November 2013
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
For those interested in a fast read and interested in a game of mind-play between the character leads, a husband and a wife, this is a good page-turner. It also elicits the questions of righteousness and a sense of morality that one should possess while being in a marital bond.

What's different about the book is that it adopts a dual-narrative approach, one from the husband, and the other from the wife, in alternating chapters. This I think added to mine and in general adds to a reader's inquisitiveness in the progress of a story, due to a regular change in the readers' minds in their siding with the characters due to the new information that keeps sprouting up. Telling anything else would be giving more-than-required insight into the story than I think the author would approve of.

Also, Amazon's delivery as always was impeccable, neatly packed, in good condition, and on time.

I really had fun reading this book. One of the best novels I've read. And believe me you wont want to put this book down unless its an emergency. The thriller in this book is really fantastic. I was really excited to read not knowing what would be at every turn of the page in store for me now. Surprising mystery that gets interesting at every level. I liked the perfect ending which could be tragic to some people of course. Insane read to be more precise

3.0 out of 5 starsTotally unpredictable
ByAnkit Deshmukhon 26 November 2014
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
You should read this if you are into thrillers. I have to admit that the initial part of this book is very very very boring but as the story proceeds it grabs your eyes and won't let them dangle anywhere else. At one time I was like "why did I bought this book!!" but later I was not able to put it down. Totally unpredictable. I would suggest the readers that if you feel that the book is boring just don't quit reading... keep on turning the pages. you won't be disappointed. The book has well timed twists and turns. The reason I'm giving it a 3 star is because the initial part of the book is really boring it could have been a lot better. But the latter part deserves a 4 star.

I bought this book owing to the enormous amount of hype it generated,i wanted to watch the movie but couldnt make it so decided to read the book..:(

5.0 out of 5 starsMissing wife, husband the suspect, but not your regular crime story
Byaayush kanton 9 April 2016
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
A woman is reported missing. Days later, the body is still not found, and the suspicion falls on the husband. He stumbles upon some clues and tries to clear his name. Will he be successful?

The plot to the book seems to be a cliched one. And the book simply follows this storyline, to the point of infusing a serious boredom upon the readers. And then suddenly the twisted psychology of the characters come into play. All the liking the reader had developed towards the central characters vanishes into thin air.

This book beautifully describes the pain in an unsatisfactory marriage, one which started as a spark, followed by a fire and is now slowly fizzling out. Deep crevasses of a twisted human mind are explored making the story a bit creepy although not very dark.

After reading the book, you will hate it and hate the characters. My first words after reading it, "I don't want to marry anymore".

3.0 out of 5 starsIt's all about being wanted
ByADVAIT SUKHTANKARon 30 May 2016
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I think there is a truth of what the author wants to say here when it comes to a husband and wife relationship.
For all the hype that surrounded the book before I picked it up, I found it to be a tad slow with the story hardly moving forward. Although the end was a little unexpected, it just went on and on.
If I have to take a side here, I would go with being the lady here in terms of being opportunist and bringing her husband to her knees.

4.0 out of 5 starsAwe inspiring darkness
ByDr Maitreyee Joshion 1 February 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
Amy is a woman on the wrong side of 30s and married to Nick Dunne. She is raised in a family of psychologist parents, who happen to be the creators of a character “Amazing Amy” in a book by the same name. Amazing Amy is always amazing as the name suggests. She has no chance to be less than perfect. The book series is very popular with the kids and people in general, but the Amy at home has a constant companion to compare herself to and proving to her to be a lesser mortal, always. The whole comparison reflects and colours Amy’s relations with friends at school and her social life as she grows up. Even so, Amy is vivacious, blond and has a figure to kill. She is older than Nick and has developed a complex of nearing 40 and a fear of losing her husband’s attention as she is getting old. Amy is rich too and has funds in the form of royalty, her parents keep in her name from the Amazing Amy series. Amy develops an unsatiating drive to be loved, admired and put on the pedestal by people who enter her life and that love and admiration has to be in increasing order at each occasion and encounter. If those in her life err in their duties to love and admire her, she doles out punishments to them.The punishments could be anything from accusations of stalking, to attempting to commit suicide for her love, to raping to even framing the other person for her own murder. Amy has grown up to be sociopath who can kill and die if she wishes to get her way with people.

Nick is a writer for a magazine and has been laid off. He brings Amy to his hometown, Carthage and starts a bar by the name “The Bar”, in partnership with his twin sister, Margo( whom everyone calls Go) using money borrowed from Amy. They leave behind a life in New york against Amy’s wish. The twins are very close and “The Bar”, keeps them barely afloat in the face of a financial crises. In the backdrop are Nick’s mother who has terminal cancer and father who has Alzheimer's. Nick’s parents are divorced and his father has always been a woman hater which Nick despises and never wants to follow. Carthage is decrepit, ghost of a town after the economic meltdown. The guilt of failure and inexhaustible demands of his wife to demonstrate his love for her, makes him get entangled in an affair with Andie, his student.

On their 5th wedding anniversary, Amy disappears from their house leaving behind clues for a treasure hunt. A treasure hunt is their private anniversary ritual, that leads to Nick’s anniversary present. Nick actually hates the treasure hunt and a constant need to prove his love and commitment to Amy. The clues for the treasure hunt are verses that are relevant to some private jokes between Nick and Amy during their good times and also relevant to places where Nick deceived Amy and made love to Andie.

What follows after the disappearance of Amy is a high tension drama that touches the personal, psychological, social and the legal levels. It pictures the media with its sometimes imbecile and at times, ugly nuances. The media that has to do little with the actual case at hand and  has its own agendas to prove that serve the anchors of the shows. It presents to us the wave as it travels with troughs and peaks of public sympathy, uproar and outrage, the lawyer who is there to outsmart but who is dismissed as plain inadequate by the catch of the net thrown by the very scheming and plotting Amy, the baffled police and a completely destroyed Nick awaiting his own arrest. Nick, who is a boy next door with his own weaknesses and shortcomings and  has only an expectation of a normal life with a wife and a baby of his own.The people who have their fingers burnt in association with Amy are crying hoarse  about their experiences but their voices get drowned in the popularity of the book.  

Nick has now two ways, either get arrested eventually because the noose that Amy has thrown becomes tighter and tighter every day or apologise in front of the public and pray publically for her return. He also has to think what he would do if his wife who had planted clues to frame him for her murder, returns.  

Gone girl is a brilliant account of how private events between two people can be manipulated to the person’s convenience and are so open to be interpreted by the two people. Nick and Amy both write their individual accounts of the events on Amy’s return after she disappears, as “Amazing” and “ Psycho Bitch”, respectively. It is book about how a sociopath takes advantage of people's emotions to suit their purpose. They are tigers on a prowl, ready to pounce at the slightest clue of the commitment of a mistake. Actually sociopaths are in one sided love with themselves. They love and hate themselves equally.They create darkness in the lives of people around them that imprisons them as Amy has imprisoned Nick in the darkness as long as they live. The book is long and yet nothing seems boring or lengthy or extra. It just steadily builds its tempo and keeps you in its grips.

Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
When you start reading a book, other than the excitation of starting something new, you want to get straight into the story and be part of it as soon as possible. But with this one, you need to be patient. And then you always start thinking, in the back of your mind, many possible things about it.

a)Was it really a best seller?
b)Will they pay back the money if you return it?
C)What took you so long to start reading this book?

With this book though, it is definitely option 'C'.

ByAjita Chakrabortyon 10 June 2014
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
This is the most overrated book of recent times. First of all, this book is not thrilling at all, anyone who occasionally read thrillers or watches any popular crime series on TV or like to watch movies can easily guess the plot. Secondly, the language is very dull. There is no sweetness or humor in the language. Thirdly, the character delineation is very basic. Both Protagonists are not interesting at all.

Above all, 'Gone Girl' is a very average book and I am not gong to suggest it to anyone who value reading as their hobby.

5.0 out of 5 starsBook Review
ByAshfiya Undreon 28 June 2017
Format: Paperback
Book Review :
This is my first book I read by Gillian Flyn.
Honestly, I must say it one of the most mind boggling book one can ever read. Initially, I was procrastinating to read it, eventually I gave it a shot I am so thrilled, literally my eyes were on the verge of popping out with every twist and turns of the events. It takes you on a eventful roller coaster which make you think like: "Oh My God ! What did I just read? " I was actually awestruck as the suspense gradually unveiled. It contains unexpected plot twist that you cannot even predict the next move in your wildest dreams. It is a one of the best suspense and thriller novel you will ever come across. And the movie was icing on the the cake (special thanks to Mr. David Fincher =P)
This book also conveys a very strong message, pertaining to : How a woman can misuse the privileges set for women ? (though only a mastermind can pass through such heart pounding situations and circumstances like a pro, I mean seriously !) How far will Amy`s irrational thirst to avenge her pride can take her ? The way Amy (the leading lady of the novel) plan the whole scenario and frame Nick (her husband) for her disappearance (Oops ! SPOILER) is just next level. The way the story and the real culprit is revealed is just phenomenon.

What the book is about:

Amy Elliot Dunne is a single child of Rand and Marybeth Elliot , a psychology major from Harvard and is a irrationally pedant person who has had a prosperous childhood. Nick Dunne is a journalist in New York, born and brought up in a middle class family is the husband of Amy. On their 5th wedding anniversary, Amy disappears from their apartment without any trace. Nick unknown to reason why and how his wife suddenly disappeared is held suspicious. He swear`s to the police about his innocence, but the fate doesn't seem to be in Nick`s favour as certain evidences arise against Nick from some of Amy`s friends claiming that Amy was scared of Nick. Other strange evidences from police investigations makes his 'not-yet-confirmed-felony' more obvious to the police.
Now, whom to believe ? The strange evidences against Nick pertaining Amy`s sudden disappearance ? Or Nick`s insistence of his innocence ?
Honestly speaking my mind is literally boggled, I would absolutely, completely and indeed recommend this book to every reader especially those who are craving for suspense and thriller. This book has won my heart a hundred times.
Thank You.

There are some books that linger on in your mind ling after you have read them. Such is their power. Gone Girl is one such book for me. I bought the book when I didn't know of the hype surrounding it and therefore didn't have any specific expectations from it. But boy, did the book grip me completely! The twists and the turns in the plot were absolutely amazing and I found completing the book as quickly as I could, thinking about it whenever I couldn't read it!

4.0 out of 5 starsWorth overlooking if seen the movie.
ByRahul Singhon 16 January 2017
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
Review of Amazon:
1. As usual, Amazon was impeccable with its delivery and item condition. Delivered before the due date and dropped off with the security guard as I was unavailable. No issues with that.
Review of book:
Often the book is a better alternative to its movie adaptation (Dan Brown's books, Godfather, etc etc are classic examples). The movies are a compressed version of the book in most cases. But if you have seen the movie Gone Girl before, you haven't missed anything that the book could offer more. It runs at the same pace, has almost the same dialogues and the movie almost completely follows the book scene after scene. So avoid buying this one if you have already seen the movie. Or go for a used copy or e-book even if you really really want to read one.

4.0 out of 5 starsA psycho thriller
ByNirvanon 13 April 2016
Format: Paperback
A psycho thriller

A story of an estranged couple forced by the husband to live in a small town because of family complexities. The story takes a nasty turn when suddenly the wife disappears, and the blame falls squarely on the husband. From there the story takes enough turns to totally confuse the reader as to the true culprit of the crime. The story takes you into the mind of a psychological personality and their actions that result in the crime.

The end of the story is how you know that the book is truly unique in its content and story. There could not have been a better way to end the book, with the direction that it takes after the true characters of the story come forward. The book has a certain poetic beauty in its writing, add to that a perfect story and voila out comes a book which is hard to keep down.

1.0 out of 5 starsI personally didn't like this book tbh
ByAmazon Customeron 1 April 2017
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
I personally didn't like this book tbh. People told me to read this book so much but it was very boring in first half. The thriller was shock but confusing and ending suggest that the book is psycho. I just didn't fell good.

5.0 out of 5 starsIt's hard to find a single line of lazy writing in this meticulously crafted novel
ByLoco Pocoon 20 October 2014
Format: Paperback
Epistolary novels aren't easy to write for many reasons ranging from some serious skills with language to a nuanced understanding of diverse human perspectives, which is mostly the reason why many novelists stay clear of this format. But Gillian Flynn used it and her New Yorker diction to convey a gripping story part via a bitch (Amy) crazier than Catherine Tramell, with a hilarious side to her, and part via her coward and loser husband Nick, whose frustrated narration of the things going around him would make the readers laugh and feel sorry and not sorry for him all at once.
It's good fiction best reserved for the times when your life gets too monotonously smooth to be bearable. It happens sometimes, and if it happens in conjunction with a mood that just can't take in nonfiction, a novel like Gone Girl can fix things.

5.0 out of 5 starsOne of the best thriller books out there in the market! Interesting, witty and mind blowing!
ByAshish Shivram Poojaryon 11 October 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
Picked this book with lots of confusions because I'd a tough time reading some other books which guaranteed to bobble us but didn't. I completed this book in 4 sittings.
This story of Nick Dunne and Amazing Amy is amazing in its own sense. A man with beautiful wife, a woman with a little arrogant, but sensible husband. Everything looks fine from their description then who is the actual villian? Is it Mr. Arrogant or is it Mrs. Amazing? Well, find it yourself because if I said anything more, then Mrs. Flynn will surely find me and kill me.

Here, Mrs. Flynn didn't missed a chance to make my mind wander from the belief I got from the previous page. The book kept me thinking about the next consequence for the entire day, till I grabbed it again.

Now, coming to the condition of the book. The book was in perfect condition. Clean from each & every angle. No stain, no nothing. Words are easily readable. Thanks Amazon!

Won't you buy this book? You surely should.

5.0 out of 5 starsExquisitely crafted
Byviswakumaron 16 May 2018
Format: Kindle Edition
The novel starts with stingy tone, foibles of Nick Dunne but as you move on, twist and turns made me to glue with my kindle most of the time which I never been before.

3.0 out of 5 starsOkay
ByHarion 22 June 2017
Format: Paperback
I did like the writing style and the plot however, it did not meet the hype it has nor my expectations. It has many weak points and the crime scene is not well built, there are many flaws.

3.0 out of 5 starsPsychology of Marriage.
ByKirtida Gautamon 11 November 2015
Format: Paperback
Gone Girl is a good psychological thriller around one of the most overlooked subject in the field of psychology- the marriage! Marriage is a very important part of a person's life history and yet many a times it's potential psychological impact in the life of a person is not looked at closely.
Great work by Gillian Flynn to bring this discord of society to the surface.

BySantoshon 10 December 2014
Format: Paperback
This book was outstanding! Though it had far too many loopholes in terms of the unravelling the overall experience was really memorable and it does leave one to think long and hard about relationships. As most readers have observed , the initial portions of the book really test your mettle and once you pass through them you are in for a thrill ride. The writing is astute and the pace is just right as it looks the reader to internalise and visualise the happenings in North Carthage...Looking forward to reading her other 2 novels.

4.0 out of 5 starsA Good Read
ByMANJIRIon 6 June 2018
Format: Paperback
I was about to stop reading the book and then this wonderful twist comes up. This book keeps you thinking who is wrong. At beginning the writer kept building each character and then she takes you on a roller coaster of confusion and suspense.

5.0 out of 5 starsWorth it
Bylinda kashyapon 9 April 2018
Format: Paperback
I don't usually dot down reviews but the story is forcing me to. It's gonna change your genre. I'm not trying to be petrifying but you'll get oblivious. Give it a try. It's worth your time and it exercises your brain.
