3.0 out of 5 starspacking and delivery are all good, the book itself was disappointing
ByAJon 15 March 2017
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
while the quality of pages, printing, packing and delivery are all good, the book itself was disappointing. I had expected a thriller like 'Gone Girl' but it turned out to be nothing like that. The novel started out well, dwindled in the middle and ended as a let down.

3.0 out of 5 starsBelow my expectations
ByDr Wanion 4 March 2018
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
I'm afraid this book is your usual over the board cheap thriller and nothing out of the ordinary as suggested by some reviews /reviewers. I read this book the second time to deconstruct the plot but I'm afraid Ms Hawkins just uses a clichéd narrative and the so called 'intelligent, unexpected twists are just that- unexpected and totally not convincing. As for some critics who claim that the book is cerebral and hitchcockian... I' d emphatically say- no it is definitely not.

5.0 out of 5 starsAmazing
ByTejas Kulkarnion 19 March 2018
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
This is a very well written book. Each page will leave you with anticipating what will happen next. Characters in this book are not perfect. They are like normal people in everyday life. I almost disliked every one of them except the main character. I finished this book on Kindle in three days. Also, I will suggest you buy a kindle copy since re-reading value is less for this book since this is a one-time thriller. Also, kindle copy costs only 150 rs.

1.0 out of 5 starsPirated Copy
ByCustomeron 23 December 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
The copy they're selling is pirated. Pages 257-288 are missing in my copy and then they are repeated. It also has many typos, one can barely make sense of it.
About the book - It's overrated. Definitely not a psychological thriller. Most definitely cannot be compared to Gone Girl. The author has nothing new to offer.

3.0 out of 5 starsNot great as expected, 2.5 stars.
ByAnnaTOP 1000 REVIEWERon 22 October 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
I read The Girl on the Train because of the hype surrounding it. Also, I wanted to read the book before I watched the movie. However, the book was rather disappointing. It's just a typical crime/mystery novel with nothing new to offer. I couldn't get myself to like any of the characters. They all seemed distant to me. The positive is that it's a very fast read. It's not boring either. I read it in a day. It just doesn't offer anything new. It's a light read. I don't think I'd read the book again, but will definitely watch the movie!

>> The book was delivered earlier than expected and was in a good condition.

ByN_Son 27 February 2016
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
People are touting Hawkins as the next Gillian Flynn, or at least someone who uses a similar writing style. I agree. The book, the setting, the writing devices used are very similar. But the book stands up as her own and this work from Hawkins most definitely deserves the most sold book on Amazon for 2015 title.

ByVickyon 25 November 2015
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
The author holds the suspense till the last few pages. The premise of the plot is so unique and I guess that is the reason for the book's popularity. I would have liked to have few more characters in the mix to keep me guessing though.

I must say that the protagonist is one of the most flawed characters you will come across in novels. But you will still root for her. At times the book does test your patience when the protagonist keeps on drinking and conveniently blacks out during her middle of the night excursions.

All said, the book is a compelling page turner.

4.0 out of 5 starsA really good read!
ByRajion 29 August 2015
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
Would be ideal for a long journey. I preferred it to that much lauded book in the same genre -- "Gone Girl" (which is often compared with this one), because the storyline and characterization of "The Girl on the Train" are far more satisfying. You can empathize with the characters in the latter whereas those in "Gone Girl" leave you with the feeling that you couldn't care less what happens to any of them. The book was delivered promptly, even before the date indicated.

3.0 out of 5 starsLoser on the train
ByPoltergeiston 28 March 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
The concept of the plot was good n the book could have been very intriguing, this one turned to be a kind of fizzled out soda.

The plot is seen from the eyes of three women - main one is a drunk n loser, second promiscuous n third vain. Didn't like the way it was written - as diaries / log books of these 3 women - gave a feeling of being restricted to what these ladies think n do only. Also the story goes back n forth thereby rendering it to be stagnant for quite sometime.

But a little bit confusing, as I had to go back again and again to join the broken links, this becomes bit irritating at times when you are in the middle of suspense and don't want to waste time going backwards, that's why giving 4/5 stars. Otherwise if you love to read murder mysteries just go for it...

3.0 out of 5 starsIt's complicated.
ByNot-so-special Snowflakeon 23 June 2016
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
I kinda-sorta liked it, and I kinda-sorta didn't, so I'm kinda-sorta conflicted.
One thing I'm sure about though is that, it doesn't live up to the hype. Everybody made this book out to be some kind of mind blowing thriller that'll forever change the way you look at people (especially the ones you commute with)... well, it's not.
That being said, if you like psychological thrillers with more or less predictable endings and obscure descriptions in between that make you wonder what exactly is going on, then this book is for you.
Also, if you're an obstinate reader who will buy every book that's been making headlines lately, determined to find out all the hype is about (even if it turns out to be the worst piece of garbage that's ever written), then you need to buy this book.
It makes for a pleasant read and the best part? It's insanely cheap.

3.0 out of 5 starsis nothing like Gillian Flynn’s tale
BySAYANTANI SARKARon 5 July 2015
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
A slightly obsessed female, a not-so-perfect couple, and a missing woman.
Did this description remind you of Gone Girl? Well, it did to me too. But Paula Hawkins’s debut novel, The Girl on the Train, is nothing like Gillian Flynn’s tale.
In the very beginning of the story, we’re introduced to Rachel Watson. A middle-aged woman who takes a train to London every morning, and loves everything about the ride: the passengers, the noises, the houses passing by on the other side of the window, and most importantly, the perfect couple. The two people she has named as Jess and Jason, and who she imagines to be having the love story she wishes she had. Instead, all she has are the memories of her broken marriage and fury over her ex-husband’s shiny, new family. But then, everything changes. Jess turns out to be a woman named Megan Hipwell, who goes missing one day and her husband Scott has no clue regarding his wife’s disappearance. Did Scott kill her? Did Megan run off with her lover? Did Rachel unknowingly have something to do with it? To know the answer, you will have to read the book.
Written from the perspectives of three women, this novel gets you hooked from the very beginning. All these women appear to be slightly deranged to the point that makes the reader question their every step and that’s what makes it all so interesting. The writing is racy, the plot is intriguing and the narratives beautifully flow and weave in together to build a satisfying climax. Much like a train journey, it will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.
If only I didn’t find the ending pretty predictable, I would have given it a higher rating. But for now, I’m going with 3 out of 5 stars.

The best part of the book is the way all the things were put in forward to us it just seems so damn real you actually just get in the book like you are the protagonist. A top notch thriller i must say. Till the end you were kept in dark like who is the one, " who is the one" and in the end bam your all brains out with the astonishment. Go buy it dont think even for a single time. Paula Hawkins just stole the show......

4.0 out of 5 starsAn unputdownable thriller with lots of violence, blood shedings, jealousy, betrayal and what not!
ByGulzar Choudhuryon 29 December 2015
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
An amazingly gripping thriller that keeps the readers glued to the plot guessing right to the last page in spite of having enough scattered clues. I'm impressed with it's lucid manner of narratives how the whole story gets it's shape surrounding the day-to-day activities of a female protagonist.
I'm not sure whether it can perfectly be called a psychological thriller (my experience with this genre is very limited) but this is simply an un-put-down-able thriller with lots of violence, blood shedings, jealousy, betrayal, love, depression, alcohol, murder and what not.
Overall, this is a pretty much appreciative work considering the fact that it's the first novel by this author (I mean authoress!) and I'm looking forward for much more page turners like this from Paula Hawkins.

ByAnamika Chakrabortyon 25 December 2015
Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase
The Girl On The Train by Paula Hawkins is a Psychological Thriller Novel encircling the day to day life of the female protagonist Rachel. I loved Rachel's character potrayal as a flawed and an unpredictable woman. Rachel's longing and lonliness have been described beautifully. I also liked the Quotes used throughout the Novel. The two of my most favourite quotes are mentioned below :

(1) “The holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mould yourself through the gaps.”

(2) “It’s possible to miss what you’ve never had, to mourn for it.”

Looking forward to her next novel. Best Wishes.

3.0 out of 5 starsDecent book, decent writing
BySandhya Kon 21 August 2015
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
I bought the book after a recommendation. The story is good. For nearly half the book, you are unsure what is happening exactly. The tone is quite morose, which suits the lead character fine. The writing is decent--nothing that makes me go wow! That said, it is not shoddy writing either. The best thing is it has short, quick sentences. So, it doesn't really drag, honestly. That said, I often found myself getting a tad impatient for the end. This was not in a 'the story is so thrilling, I want to know what happens'-way. This was in a 'I can skip a few pages to get to the end'-way. The end seemed quite rushed after the fairly slow (in comparison) pace. It was not very satisfying.

All said and done, got the book on a discount. So, not really complaining about wasting any money! Decent read, all-in-all.

The characterization is rather shallow but the author has kept a nice variety. The protagonist with her poor self image and drinking habit does not get sympathy of the reader as the author wants! I couldn't understand why the female inspector wasn't very nice but it is author's prerogative

1.0 out of 5 starsBook looks tarnished & worn out. Unpleasant purchase.
ByAmazon Customeron 25 June 2018
Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase
Book looks tarnished & is worn out. Looks like it's been put to use for quite sometime, though the seller (Jaisammed Shikhar Books, New Delhi) has claimed it to be a 'new' one. Extremely unpleasant & I regret this purchase from Amazon. Returning the product ASAP.

I got this book after all the reviews and and thriller tag surrounding it. But not more than a timepass read. Sometimes the description about the female lead's thoughts is too much to take in. If you're really bored and want to read something then go for this.

3.0 out of 5 starsAn okayish thriller
ByAmazon Customeron 16 January 2017
Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase
It started off well with an interesting plot and unconventional narrative, but eventually started to wear out as we cross past half the mark. Though exciting at first, the narrative and the timeline seemed confusing a bit. And the ending was just simple and plain, far less than what I would expect from a typical thriller.

ByRajesh Shahon 30 June 2016

This was a very ok read. Its good for someone just starting with the thriller genre but for readers familiar with the genres, the twist can easily be seen halfway through the book and after that its just reading to reach that calculation. The writing too is not very sharp and edgy. We have 3 different narratives going in the book but they all sound the same.

A recommended read. The book starts of well with the train journey. The two characters starting off in two time zones finally closing in to the present. I found the characterisation of the drinking habits, a tad too detailed and sickening. However the book speeded up in the later stages making up for the earlier parts

I never expected a twist like this at the end of novel. It drives you crazy. If u love suspense then you have to read this.
